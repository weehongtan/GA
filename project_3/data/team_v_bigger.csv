2020-04-04 22:26:31,Custom Backgrounds for Teams - A quick hack to add custom backgrounds,"MSFT just updated my Teams client and now I can change backgrounds just like Zoom allows.  Only problem is there's no way to choose your own background - you must choose from their five canned backgrounds.   BUT I figured out how you can add your own...  On a Mac, add a JPG or PNG to the following folder, and it will appear with the five stock backgrounds to choose from:  
/users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams/Backgrounds/Uploads

You may need to hold down the OPTION key before you choose GO from the Finder Menu to get the Library to appear.

New to Teams here and was able to set it up this past week for my company using an Exploratory License. We do not have Office 365 but rather on premise Exchange. So therefore, no Exchange Online etc.

My question is so far everything is working ok enough for our needs. However we are unable to chat with anyone outside of our domain.  Initially, we were able to but then something has changed and now when we try to chat to someone in another domain or vice versa, we get an error message.  The message states that our organizations are not setup to communicate with one another.

Is this something that is not available with the Exploratory license, or did MS suddenly turn something off due to COVID-19 etc?

Thanks in advance.",1.0,1.0,NA,5.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/fuwjv0/teams_exploratory_license_issuequestion/,Trooper27

2020-04-07 17:35:43,Q: Teams Admin Center Users provisioning,"Hi!

Due to the COVID-19 virus, we have created something like 50 tenants, for customers to start using Microsoft Teams and be able to work from home.

There's 2 tenants where the users won't provision in the Teams admin center.  
The only user available is the Administrator (see attached screenshot).

The problem for us is, since the users won't be provisioned, they won't be able to communicate with external users since no (Teams)policies are applied to the users.

Has anyone had this problem before, and maybe the solution?  
We have a call about this issue at Microsoft, but still without a solution.

&amp;#x200B;

2) When a few clients joined they appeared to have audio issues. There doesn't seem to be any audio settings at all in the web version. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) How are people inviting people to these events? It seems if you do the meeting request in teams, anyone who gets that can see the list of all the other people in the meeting

Team application installed on my iPhone and on my laptop. same account signed in in both instances.

Good: I can join meetings from both devices at the same time ( eg: sound in my ears, scree sharing on my laptop

Bad: if someone call me directly I take the call on my iPhone. I didn't find yet how I can join the call from my laptop and see the screen sharing.

&amp;#x200B;

Workaround: Quckliy create a meeting ""now"" and ask the caller to hang-up and join the meeting.

2020-04-09 21:21:08,Roadmap Update - raise hands in Teams meetings.,"It's getting fast-tracked...  


The new raise hands feature in Teams allows meeting attendees to  identify that they wish to speak by toggling the hand icon in the  meeting control bar, making it easier to actively participate in  meetings.  When a meeting participant has raised their hand, an icon  will appear next to their name in the roster view as well as their  profile picture or video on the main meeting stage. Both the attendee  who raised their hand and any presenter can lower individual hands in  the meeting.  Raise hands will be available for both PC, Mac, and  web-based clients to start, with mobile applications quickly following.   We will continue to iterate and enhance this new feature in the coming  weeks.   


Projected Release is April 2020. I've had the opportunity to kick the tires on this, and its simple and effective. Several here have asked for this feature, so I'm sharing.

Has anyone experienced an issue whereby Teams has partially uninstalled itself from the user profile. We deploy via our software deployment app and this follows the process by Installing the exe installer locally which in turn will be called when a user logs in, if they do not have teams on their profile it will be installed.

This works fine but then some users who have successfully used Teams a couple of times report that it no longer functions, then on investigation of the installation to  'C:\\Users\\xxxxxx\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Teams the majority of the files and folders are missing. 

I've checked the logs created but there isn't anything in the logs to suggest a failure and also our software deployment app reports a successful installation. Have looked at Anti-Virus but nothing to suggest that any files have been removed due to suspect activity.

2020-04-13 18:29:54,Announcing Microsoft Bot Framework SDK for Go,"Consequent to a great feedback to BotKube, an application for messengers like Slack and Mattermost to monitor and debug Kubernetes deployments, we have got interests from Microsoft Teams users for an integration. An integration, which would help them monitor their Kubernetes cluster from a Teams client. Since BotKube is architecturally designed to work independently of a messaging platform, it seemed a viable thing to integrate it with Teams.

&amp;#x200B;

Microsoft Teams uses the Microsoft Bot Framework to allow users to write bot applications. The Bot Framework is a set of tools, SDKs, templates and services to build conversational bot applications. The official SDKs are available for Python, C#.NET, Java and Javascript. Since BotKube is built in Go, there was a need of an interface to the Bot Framework services in Go, for a seamless integration of BotKube to Teams. This encouraged us to write a Go SDK that wraps the services of the Bot Framework.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, we are excited to announce the first release of the Bot Framework SDK for Go; an SDK written in Go that enables users to build bot applications over the Bot Framework in Golang. The SDK enables application developers to build conversational bots for Microsoft Teams.

&amp;#x200B;

A bot application built using this SDK can send text, interactive cards and attachments in a conversation with a user. Apart from a receive-reply conversation, developers can build bot applications to push messages in a conversation to Teams client.

Should they chat in different SharePoint sites when its specific to sales, admin, etc or should I be creating a general chat area that's private on the intranet SharePoint team? I guess my concern is they start uploading sales docs to a general chat when it should be within the sales Team/SharePoint?

They currently had one chat group in hangouts where all communication went but feel I should be maybe getting them to switch chats dependant on relevance?

One example is the Marketing team will ask the group of 5 if they can provide images of what they are working on for social media - this couldn't be communicated within the Marketing SharePoint chat though since its restricted to Marketing only.

This one particular user had a weird issue a couple of weeks ago and through the troubleshooting I removed and resynced them from our 365 deployment, which of course removed them from all previous team memberships because they were now a new GUID/ID on the Azure side.

As the various teams that the user was a member of started to add the user back, they were all receiving errors of ""the attempt failed at this time, please try later.""  This was being performed by regular Azure/365 users that were the Team Owner.

To prepare for troubleshooting this week I had one of the Team owners make me a co-owner so I could see the error and figure out what was going.  My account is also a Global Admin.  When I tried adding the same user, they added without any problem, and I was even able to promote them to co-owner of the group that I was given access to, since he previously was a co-owner of that group.

I'm about to ask the owner of the original group that was having issues to try adding the user again, they have been able to add other users.  If there is still a problem I don't want to try fixing this without becoming a co-owner because of the potential of being a temporary co-owner of every group to add the user to.

2020-04-14 21:52:58,Teams Free: Video Calls only allowed for private use?,"Hello,

there's an article about connecting people with MS Teams in the current issue of the German tech-magazine c't.

They claim that it's only allowed to do ""video-calls"" privately in the free version of Teams (c't 2020, Issue 9, Page 21, last paragraph of ""Videokonferenzen"").

So business meetings would therefore be forbidden.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't find anything about that on the internet.

Is this really true?

Slack’s unique features:

* Customization: Slack allows you to customize the look of your Slack’s UX with various theme and color options so that it fits with your desired look and feel.
* Hundreds of integrations: Slack ties in with more than 800 different app integrations (although this is limited to 10 for free users.)
* One-to-one video calling: This feature is offered free, and can include up to 15 attendees per call for paid users.
* Versatility: While Teams is native to the Microsoft operating system, Slack is more versatile and is even compatible with the Linux operating system.
* Simplicity: With fewer bells and whistles, Slack is easy to deploy and requires little training for new users.

Microsoft Teams unique features:

* Advanced bots: The built-in bots in Teams leverage AI to make it easy for users to search for departmental and personal data of other users and get connected to the right person quickly.
* Integration with Microsoft Office 365: Since this tool is owned by Microsoft, it’s automatically included in the Office 365 package, meaning it also integrates with all other tools in that suite. This means that no email integration is required as well, as it’s native to the tool.
* Large scale video/audio communication: Teams includes both video and audio calling tools for up to 250 people at a time, plus a recording feature for those who weren’t able to attend in real time or who want to watch a replay to take additional notes.
* Encrypted data &amp; integrations: Data security is a priority on Teams, with things like two-factor authentication required for users. Teams also has a list of 180 app integrations it works with, which is significantly less than Slack, but still fairly robust.",1.0,0.0,NA,10.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/g1600c/slack_vs_microsoft_teams_comparison/,okrguy

1. Reports of a guest being able to ""start a meeting"" where the dialog box pops up on the employee's screen stating that ""xxx has started the meeting."" Is this normal behavior?
2. Reports of guests being able to both see the lobby for the meeting AND admit people that are waiting in the lobby... From everything I can find on the internet and read, this should not be possible, especially for guests users. Is this happening for any specific reason? Some information:
   1. We have meetings scheduled recurring within a ""team"" in the ""general"" channel. We have invited guests to this team so that they can easily see the meetings that are scheduled and not need us to send them new links every week to be able to join. Would a guest being on a team then somehow enable them to admit people from the lobby, even though they are not a member of our organization?

I logged into the web client and discovered about 20 messages in those threads that just simply aren't in the desktop client.

2020-04-15 20:42:04,Showing 2 video streams at once?,"Hiya :)

So I'm working on getting my company set up with online music lessons and I'm aware that there isn't a way to show 2 cameras at once (like there is on Zoom). Side note - we can't use Rooms as these are lessons taking place in people's  homes. 

The purpose of finding a solution for this is so our drum kit tutors can have an overhead video shot of their kit and also a video feed of their face for the pupil to see. 

I'm trying to come up with a solution and I wonder if either of the following will work?

Option 1
- The tutor sets their main camera as the overhead camera.
- They then open the camera/webcam app on their PC and view the other camera through this app.
- They screenshare the camera/webcam app so the pupil can see the tutor's face and the drum kit.
- The pupil can then pin whichever screen they like to their screen.

I'm aware this option may cause video lag of the tutor's face because of the screen share.

Option 2
- The tutor joins the meeting as a guest using a different account enabling them to show a second camera. 

I haven't explored this method but I assume this would have to take place on a different device to avoid Teams getting confused.
They would also need to mute the audio and mic on the second device to prevent feedback.

This is to help my Co-workers with learning to use Teams.   One of the items to be included in the training is the meeting tool bar, cam control, muting the mic, etc.  I don't know how to show the tool bar without being in a meeting.


The thought of doing a Camtasia recording rather the using Teams record meeting function is that I can improve the quality of the recording.
The recording would be uploaded to Stream so that it could be shared on Teams.    


I've done training with small groups by sharing my screen in a meeting, this worked well.  Now I'm faced with a large group of people and it's difficult to get everyone to meet.    Posting a video on Teams would give the users free access to the training.   I suppose if management doesn't mandate that users train on using teams then adoption would be relatively low.

I've set up conference calling so that when I organize a Teams meeting a conference number is available for people to use to call in if desired. It's a Toronto number, it is not toll-free.

I've also purchased communications credits.

My problem is that on a 50-minute call we seem to have spent $60 dollars. 

I've tried to read through all of Microsoft's documentation on how this works and pricing but I'm not finding it to be clear.

Is it correct that if someone calls into the number there is no charge on our end, but if the system calls out to that person we now pay for that via communication credits?

Does it matter if the system calls out to a number in a different Canadian province? This is technically long distance (though almost all   personal phone plans don't charge you anything extra for long distance calls within Canada). I found a pricing spreadsheet online from Microsoft but it only shows $0.061 per minute in Canada with no long distance cost shown.

2020-04-17 05:00:53,How to stop Teams from opening up when someone else starts a meeting and close after updates,"I have a problem with Teams showing me as available when I don't want it to.

For example, I had a meeting scheduled the other day.  I was on time for the meeting and waited almost an hour for the other party to show up.  After 50 minutes, I assumed they were not going to make it, so I closed down Teams.

Then, about 55 minutes after the meeting was supposed to start, apparently they finally showed up, because Teams reopened again, all by itself, and I got a notification they had entered the meeting on my desktop.  I didn't have time to have the meeting by then, and would have just preferred that Teams stayed shut down.

I don't want Teams to ever open by itself.

Also, I have noticed that after Teams updates, which seems like almost weekly, the app stays open, showing me as available when I might not see it's open, or even be in the house.  Thus I seem unreliable to people who may be trying to chat with me.

When I eventually see that Teams has been open for hours I have to go in and explain to people what happened.  Then I look unreliable, untrustworthy, and also people can't trust if my ""available"" yellow dot is for real or not.

Needless to say both these behaviors are very annoying.

Did a bit of digging, but unfortunately did not find any relevant information. 

We've been doing a slow roll out of Teams at the office for various different reasons but due to everything going on with COVID-19 we've been having a few users requesting to have access to use Teams instead of Skype, some mainly just for having a ""team"" group to collaborate with, screen sharing...etc etc.

We're thinking of deploying this out into some of our RDS servers, but some of the info I've found lead me to believe its not a great idea as it seems to be a storage hog (installing in the app data folder of each user...etc etc) Is this still an issue, or is there any workarounds for this? 

Additionally, is there a way to stop the application from auto-launching upon login, so it doesn't force it upon every single user - only those who wish to use it?

Is there an app within teams that would allow documents (i.e. pdf) to be pushed out to selected persons for review/markup. And again once comments Incorporated to send out again for sign-off, being able to track status on drawings (i.e who is yet to review/sign etc).

Currently this process is manual using emails and very time consuming chasing people and status .

2020-04-18 22:19:39,Trying to know if Microsoft Teams Phone calling is worth it?,"I am currently trying to see if purchasing a Microsoft Teams phone service and voice plan is worth it? 

Some background: We have a Digium PBX with around 80 active desk phones. All are DID numbers and we have a PRI trunk for service. This has been working great until COVID. Now 90% of our workforce is at home and we are not forwarding phones due to the limited number of lines we have. Cost for the PRI is around 450 per month and around 3500 annual for phone support and software updates.  Total around 9k annual

From what I see the Teams voice option is $20 per user per month as we need the phone license and a calling plan per person. We would get all new numbers, local, and the ability for people to call from home. Doing the math that is around 17k per year.  This is 2x more for the Teams voice option vs the local PBX, not counting some hardware needs as well.

The on-site pdx system does not have a good way to work remotely, unless I purchase soft phones and hardware, and people currently use personal cell phones for calls. Their desk vm’s arrive in their email as attachments.  But users don’t like this personal  cell usage and I don’t know how long this WFH will last so I am trying to see what to do with Teams voice?

 When I am trying to change a photo in MS Teams error message is appearing:

In my opinion, it is related due to the fact that we are still running on Exchange On-Prem.

2020-04-20 16:16:47,Advice for teachers,"Hi all, 

In our strange new world, I am now teaching Maths lessons from Microsoft teams and I'm trying to get the most out of it. I was wondering if anyone has suggestions of functionality/bots/apps which would help me. 

My biggest problem is that I can't see whether the students are doing the set questions and I can't see how well they are doing with questions ETC. I've been experimenting with Polly and Forms for giving them multiple choice. That is useful but limited. 

I'm particularly looking at some kind of ""to do"" tracker, where students could tick off different tasks I set them and I could see who is at what point. I'm also looking for something where the students could submit a short sentence of explanation and I could see all the answers in one place but their classmates couldn't see it. I'm very open to any other ideas which could be repurposed into an educational format.

2020-04-21 00:31:45,How does licensing for live events work?,"I've tried looking online, and even tried opening a support request with Microsoft, but neither way has yielded a solid answer.

We're trying to figure out how the limits for live events works.

My org has approx 150 E3 users.  For any external user that we invite to a teams meeting / live event, I believe a guest account would be created in our AAD tenant, and the docs say that AAD has a 1:5 ratio (licensed users to guest users), which would suggest that with 150 licensed users, we should be able to have 900 guest accounts.

So my questions are:

* For a Teams live event, we're trying to determine how many external people would be able to join.  The docs say that a live event can support up to 10,000, but I presume that it's based on some sort of licensed users ratio similar to how guest accounts work.
* My understanding is that a guest account is created any time you invite an external user for any type of sharing / collaboration (i.e. teams meeting/live event, OneDrive/Sharepoint file sharing, etc.).  I'm not aware of any mechanism to determine how/why guest accounts were created, so once they exist, they pretty much have to stay there forever because you don't really have any way to tell which accounts were one-time use vs which are being used on an ongoing basis, so if you delete them you run the risk of breaking things, right?
* Based on the above, it seems like given a long enough time period, you'll eventually run out of guest accounts.  Is there some mechanism by which you can get more (that doesn't require purchasing additional E3 licenses)?

tl;dr - Org is interested in using Teams live events, but having a hard time understanding how the licensing works.",1.0,1.0,NA,9.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/g4w14u/how_does_licensing_for_live_events_work/,vrtigo1

We then set global permissions to basically off, except for what we wanted the call center to have.  The call center will just participate in meetings and channels.  They won't have chat or meet-now.

A few hours later, features like calling and screen sharing turned off for all users.

Based on this, it seems that ""Global org wide"" is the global setting for on/off, NOT just another policy set.  Is that correct?

In other words, if we wanted ""meet now"" turned on for some users, it would need to be ON in ""Global org wide"" then explicitly turned off in a policy for that user?
.... in that case, in our situation, we should actually leave Exec Mgmt as ""global"" and then manually assign (or PowerShell) the more restrictive policies to the call center staff?

I work in a studio, under normal conditions I would pass everything through a video / audio switcher and an encoder before feeding Teams.  As it stands everything will be fed remotely and switched in Teams.   My thought was to have a TD (technical director) handle the switching of the sources.  Our producer would do what she does, produce.  She would monitor the presenters and keep the meeting on track.   Would I simply assign both the TD and Producer the role of Producer in Teams?   Having two producers would give us some redundancy.  If one of them got bounced offline the other could keep the meeting going.


I've seen a lot of mentions of the moderator for Q &amp; A.   I assume the moderator is also a Producer?    I understand that there's a limit of 10 presenters.  Do crew members count toward that limit?   In the scenario above with the TD and Producer serving as the crew, can I add 10 presenters or only 8?


This event is an annual meeting.  Typically we consolidate all the PowerPoint presentations into one.   We have one operator control the PPT for all the speakers.

Is there a way to be able to create appointment links without having teams installed? If they use the web version as they are, there is no 'Calendar' option as their mailboxes aren't on office 365.

2020-04-22 06:01:29,Teams Only Upgrade with On-Premise Lync 2013 No Hybrid Configured Possible to Force?,"I have got a good one here boys &amp; gals.

We have a legacy Lync 2013 on-premise solution that we need to keep because we have two hospitals that we support that use it to communicate with. These are huge hospitals with multiple teams, hundreds of folks that communicate with our team. The unfortunate issue is the guy who supported this infrastructure is no longer with us and we also have no Microsoft support for it so it's a big no-no to update and patch and possibly break something. So no go on Hybrid configuration as well.

We are using Microsoft teams as well since everything else we do is in the cloud. We have Azure AD Connect configured and syncs our on-premise AD with Azure AD.

The issue is no one who has an account in the on-premise Lync server is able to search for external contacts (federate). Anyone who is not on the on-premise server can search for external contacts. This makes the users in Teams upgrade policy the org-wide setting and the ones on just teams Team Only. For the record the global upgrade Org-Wide setting is Teams-Only

I have proven this by adding myself back to the Lync server and within about 3 hours lost the ability to search for external contacts. Interestingly enough I removed my user object from one of the syncing OU's to take take the experiment further and made myself a cloud user. Within a few hours, I was once again able to search for external contacts. Then I realized no synced passwords will occur so not a good solution for my users. I added myself back on Saturday to the syncing OU and went from a cloud user to a synced user again. Today is Tuesday and I still have the ability to search for external contacts AND still a user on Lync. How can I make other users ""Teams Only"" without having hybrid setup and keeping users on the on-premise Lync server? When I try in the Team's admin center it errors out mentioning that the user is an on-premise user. 

Suggestions?

\- I cannot configure hybrid.  
\- I cannot make users cloud than back again (this logged me out of everywhere and have to select new users, end-users would be calling for weeks if did this)

In my mind, this is no different from the large private channel that was operating with 30 people in it exchanging information.  


So since he now has elevated admin rights, can he see the previous chats i have had with my team in the private chats? There is nothing there, but I would rather know so we are all protected.

Most workplaces have zeroclients with vmware Horizon client and only a few have a laptop. We don't want to use vdi for Teams. So management came up with idea to install generic devices in some quiet rooms, so people can join a meeting when needed. Thing is that these devices can't be connected to our Windows domain/internal lan. 4G only. We're looking for a solution that allows people start Windows, start Teams desktop app, authenticate, meetup and log out when finished. Ideally leaving no local Windows profile behind. We looked at Windows 10 Kiosk Mode, but we're having a hard time getting it to work with the Teams desktop app. We also looked at certified Teams devices, like the Lenovo Thinksmart View, but that's Android based and we don't think it will support multiple users easily.

Almost as if it just copied down a hard copy of everything. So I went to one of the channels and instead of selecting sync in Teams, I opened in SharePoint and synced from there. That seemed to have worked. The only issue is she has 40+ folders ""synced"" from the Teams app, so when we go to sync in SharePoint it'll create the same folder but put a (1) next to it. I get it, we can't have duplicate folders. If I rename the folders that aren't syncing or move them somewhere else it automatically logs you out of OneDrive and you have to log back in again and resync everything.

Got a bit of a question/issue here. Right now we have Microsoft team setup where we were able to control permissions at a very fine level by using SharePoint. My boss wants me to move that team into a private channel under a different Team. That's all well and good. The only issue is, from the docs that Microsoft has provided, we shouldn't mess with the permissions outside of Teams (in other words, no more hacking with SharePoint to do some funky thing).

Does anyone know if it possible to make the members of a private channel not have permission to move/delete files while the channel owner can delete and move files?

With the institution of remote education, I need to start learning and testing using external encoders to produce there and create events in Stream instead, to bypass the limitations of producing in Teams. The standard Live Event produced in Teams usually suits fine, but there are needs for large, C-Level events that have a lot more complex requirements. 

I have been looking into using OBS which has great features, however it looks like the limitation may be having a lot of remote presenters, who also may not be very tech savvy. There is the need to get the webcam/desktop feed for all the presenters and from what I can see, OBS would require a middleman RTMP server or a plugin. Not 100% this is the case though.

Does anyone have experience with this and have any recommendation on encoders or setups? My primary needs are to be able to source multiple camera feeds from ""Presenters"" including their desktop capture in some cases, and for it to be as easy as possible from the ""Presenter"" side of things, leadership inst always tech savvy... In addition we would need the ability to project title cards, slideshows, media, etc but that should usually be handled from the ""Producer"" standpoint locally so I imagine that wouldn't be an issue for any encoder.

I apologize for the complex request but haven't been able to find much documentation or examples of this and am very new to using these encoders and AV in general (Product Owner for Microsoft stack so not a whole lot of knowledge on AV outside of Teams haha) Thanks in advance!",1.0,1.0,NA,7.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/g6qilf/microsoft_live_events_with_external_encoders/,Aphrodiziac

Bit of an odd one. I'm fairly sure the problem is on the other end not ours but thought I'd just ask just in case. 

As far as I'm aware external access inwards and outwards from our organisation is fine - I've had chats/video calls/meetings with external guests hosted from our organisation and vice versa.

The problem comes with one particular organisation - we're trying to schedule a meeting and we add all the participants email addresses and then save and send the meeting invites. Once the meetings scheduled if you go back into it, the external users email addresses all vanish and they tell me they haven't received any invite. 

It's only happening with one external organisation - I can send invites to others and they get the invite.

Just wondering if there's a security setting on their end that means only they can invite people to meetings and not the other way around? We've had teams calls with them but they've always hosted the meeting. Now it was our turn to host and I couldn't get the invite sent out!

I'm just looking for some advice please.

My team consists of approximately 30 odd people and every Wednesday we are having a group activity through Microsoft Teams, in previous weeks we have had bingo, standard quizzes and one of those ""guess the word based on emojis"".

With the help of a partner it is now our turn to come up with something. I'm really rubbish at things like this so I was hoping any of you may have some ideas?

One idea I had was sort of a Eurovision contest, people pick a country and a song from that country and then everyone rates that song...but unfortunately we have only 20-30 minutes and its going to be pretty difficult to get everyone to listen to each song and rate in that time frame.

Another I had was maybe start with a line that sets up a story, then people go in and add a sentence or paragraph to see what story we can come up with - but I don't feel like that will work very well with the amount of people in the chat, also most people might not feel confident writing something.

It needs to be something engaging but also something where people won't have to speak on the call if they don't want to.

I can NEVER look at planner tabs within the android teams app. No one on my work team can either. It only works on iOS. 

Why can you not open more than one window? If you're gonna have so many apps build in to one make it so we can use two windows instead of constantly going back and forth. 

Why does this app crash so often? It absolutely dominates the CPU and RAM usage on every windows 10 pc I've used it on, including my top notch gaming pc. 

Why are notifications options so limited. Most of the time the options do not work anyway. They ignore Windows alarms only mode too. 

Why does it not run properly on android unless you have the app running. I have it set as an exception to all power saving and data saving measure, yet it STILL doesn't get background updates. i have to open the app to get messages almost always. This has occurred across both my iphone and android.

2020-04-28 10:49:31,Email not being received in Teams,"Hi all,

I have a strange problem and I cannot figure out why this is happening.  

We have a Teams channel called Support.  We have a mailbox in Office 365 which is called support@.  This then forwards all emails to the Teams Support Address.   I have set up a contact in Exchange.  It seems that all messages are getting through except for one address.  This email address is for all our phone messages.  They are being delivered to the support@ mailbox and we can see a message trace to see it was in fact sent to the Teams address, but there is no alert in the channel.  

Does Teams have it's own mail filtering outside of Exchange Online?

I found the following article that seems to match our issue, but no resolution.

If you have a small office (less than 30 employees and about the same amount of potential guests)...is it better to:

or

B -  create each project as its own team.  Maybe you employ channels as needed under each team or not.

She has a macbook air circa 2017 running Catalina, and she uses teams. Her workflow for a meeting works something like this:

1. Open a browser
2. Open a web service called SSO (which I presuming in a Microsoft SSO)
3. Log into mac part the SSO with standard company details (there's a PC part which apparently works much better for the other 99% of people in the company)
4. Click on an icon in the dashboard of the SSO (or whatever the SSO dumps you into, all still in the browser)
5. This automatically brings up a local application--it's the mac App Store as far as I can tell from her description--with something to do with Microsoft teams in it (presumably the teams app?)
6. Click on 'the thing' (perhaps 'install'--though she insists it is impossible to install it and have it work with the company's settings, because it's done through the browser because of the Sensitive Data)
7. Teams opens

(Point to note: the app store is still open at this point and has to remain open. If she closes it then she loses access to the sso and has to start all over again. While she has access to the SSO if she interacts with her computer outside of it, the SSO signs her out (this is meant as a security measure))

2020-04-29 17:12:20,Allow external people access to ONE specific Team,"I've got a bit of a strange question: Is it possible to limit/control external access on a per-team basis?

Background: We've recently introduced Teams due to the pandemic, but we've also locked things down so that the users themselves cannot create Teams, and those that ARE members of a team cannot invite external people into them. This is done in order to both have control over how many teams there are, and also because there are documents that aren't to be shared outside of the house.

Now, of course, there's a collaboration with one of our external suppliers who use Teams themselves. One solution would of course have THEM create a team and invite the people from our site that needs to be in it, but that would also mean that the supplier gets ownership of the team and also thus the documents in said project.

I found this post over on the MS TechCommunity, but it doesn't seem to fit:  [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams/allow-or-block-guest-users-from-a-specific-team-in-microsoft/m-p/175918](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams/allow-or-block-guest-users-from-a-specific-team-in-microsoft/m-p/175918)

We are currently deploying Teams and we are discussing the governance we should have in place for creating a Team vs a Channel in an existing Team. 

We have group creators locked down to a security group, so that’s stopped everyone creating a Team, but I was wondering how other organisations control Team creation, e.g. what approvals processes are in place and what criteria need to be met before a Team is provided?

2020-04-29 22:09:31,Teams design at larger professional services firm,"Our firm has just rolled out Teams recently, and I am wondering about best practices to deploy this.  I'm not a technical person, and we are pretty much left to our own devices.  I need a plan, and would appreciate some input.  
  
My problem is I am not sure the best way to structure Teams and Channels.  We are a professional services firm of about 5,000 employees.  I have found that for each job we do, it would be very nice to have a channel to keep all discussions and files.  I've not yet explored some of the extended abilities such as the Task thing.  Now, what makes this so complicated?  
  
A few definitions and metrics I am working with:  

- Employees: 5,000  
- Job: an assignment we do for a client, typically by an engagement team  
- Engagement team size: typically 3 to 8 people, pulled from the 5,000 employees (as you can see, [there are many, many permutations possible here](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=5000+choose+8)) *See note  
- Job duration: 1 or 2 months, after which the channel can be archived/destroyed  
- Number of concurrent jobs: many, but let's assume 5,000 to 10,000 at any given point in time  
- Jobs are confidential: Yes.  
   
Note: At a professional services firm, you would typically structure a team as follows:  

+ 1 Managing Director or Director (let's call them MD or D)
+ 1 Senior Manager or Manager (let's call them SM or M)
+ x Staff
  
So, what have I considered?  
  
Option A - Team created under each MD for their portfolio of jobs.  Issue: Unable to create enough private channels in a team.  Let's assume a MD has a portfolio of 100 concurrent jobs, D has 75, SM has 50, M has 30.  From this, it would seem we'd need to have a Manager own it, and even then there's a limit of 30.  It will also create a bit of an awkward view for the MD having to look at say, 50 Teams where his portfolio is spread, but there's some sort of seach button I'm told. Okay.

Option B - New team for each job.  I don't think this advisable.  Each team comes with a bunch of other stuff, and it is simply not required.  
  
Option C - Let me create channels without an associated Team?  Why can this not happen?  
    
Option D - Change HR.  Deploy more dedicated *people teams*.  Have specific people always work together.  Yes, technically that can be done. A MD can do all jobs with the same D, SM, M, and staff.  But, there are significant *people drawbacks* with this arrangement and this will never fly.  
  
The fundamental problem is we ""spawn"" new teams daily, and each team is allocated based on people's work load, so the number of total permutations is very large.  With the requirement of confidential engagements, we really can't create public channels.  
  
Ideas appreciated.  At this point, it looks like we may need a ""Team MD-D"" for each possible MD-D combination out there...",1.0,1.0,NA,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gaa50s/teams_design_at_larger_professional_services_firm/,zcexplorer

I picked up a CCX 500 to do the initial testing and seem to be caught in a sort of no man's land that I can't find very much info on.

The CCX 500 arrived with what appears to be the only available Poly UC firmware: 5.9.12.1122

I booted it up, selected the Teams base profile, signed in, and it was immediately registered in Teams admin center. Good so far. I can make/receive calls from the device and I can apply config profiles from the admin center.

However, I have two problems, possibly related to each other.

1) Teams admin center does not seem to recognize 5.9.12.1122 as a valid, certified firmware. It wants to ""update"" the device to 1.0.0.2535.

2) I'm stuck on Teams 1449/1.0.94.2019110802 and Teams admin center is not offering any further updates, it just wants to update the firmware. If I let admin center update the firmware to 1.0.0.2535, it still thinks all other components are up to date and does not offer any updates.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a ticket open with Microsoft since Tuesday, but am still working with lower level support. They indicated that 5.9.12.1122 is the correct firmware, but there is an issue on the MS side of things and also pointed me to the only mention of this issue on Poly's forums: [https://community.polycom.com/t5/VoIP-SIP-Phones/CCX-500-v-5-9-12-1111-download/td-p/108333](https://community.polycom.com/t5/VoIP-SIP-Phones/CCX-500-v-5-9-12-1111-download/td-p/108333)

So ... it looks like this has been an issue since February ...

Currently waiting to hear from a higher level of support, but everyone is understandably quite busy.

&amp;#x200B;

Teams 1449/1.0.94.2019110802 for phones is pretty underwhelming, given there is no speed-dial, and calling anyone who isn't in the GAL requires dialing their full 10 digit number or finding them in call history.

&amp;#x200B;

It also shouldn't be able to, I turned off the Windows setting to allow other applications to take control of the microphone, but I suspect because this is a Microsoft program that they just call a certain function in Windows that overrides that setting to tweak the microphone volume anyway. I have a RODE NT-USB in case anyone's wondering.

Has anyone else ran into this?",1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gcqjx8/microphone_volume_keeps_getting_boosted/,SimplyTemperate

The website and LinkedIn updates *could* be done via manual posting, though ideally an automated system would be preferred. There would be a handful of updates per week maximum.

Our tweets are more of an issue. We tweet up to a dozen times a day so manual posting is out of the question.

I've looked at IFTTT to create a daily tweet digest which works, though I'd need to do a forward from the registered email address to the channel address and would rather just cut out that part of the process.

[Automate.IO](https://Automate.IO) and Zapier seem to be options though I'm not sure without testing what format the tweets would look like.

Flow/Power Automate seems to be clunky.

I've considered writing myself something in Perl, but I feel this is a last resort.

2020-05-05 02:36:48,Best Practice for Setup of Teams To Scope Correctly,"Migrating from Slack to Teams. I'm the slack point of contact for my company, but not performing the actual migration.

\_more details\_

For instance, if I'm part of DevOps group, we do collaborate with other teams, but if a ""team"" in Microsoft Teams is focused on a smaller actual collaboration unit, then should a team be structured smaller almost like an active directory group? Or should 300 users be all in the same ""team""? 

Since in Slack most things are channel based, I figured this would be good to know, as any team calendars, azure boards, and other app integrations might be more specific to a smaller unit and didn't want to have ""teams"" be 300 people all seeing the same stuff if there is a better way to structure. Also figured it might have performance benefits if a ""Team"" for 300 people loads more, then perhaps smaller teams makes more sense.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gdh9xm/best_practice_for_setup_of_teams_to_scope/,g00py3

I'm trying to find out if there is a way to add someone who is outside my organization to an MS Teams team. I'm able to add someone from outside the organization, but only as a guest. The only way for that person to access the team as a guest, appears to be by clicking the link in an email that is delivered notifying that person that they've been added. Once that person clicks on the link, they are given an option to open MS Teams and switch to the organization for which they are a guest. However, when they do this, they can only see items in the guest organization and not their own items. Once they switch back to their own organization on MS Teams, the only way to get back to the guest organization again is to do the process all over again.

I'm wondering if there is a way to add that person so that they are a full member and do not have to switch over to a guest organization.

For those with the desktop Outlook, they create a new Teams meeting via their calendar and it generates the Join Meeting URL and the Meeting Options URL, which are really handy and effective. But what I'd like to know is, well... Is there any way a powershell or app or something could be built in our tenant that allows a teacher who doesn't have the full outlook to type in a desired meeting name into a box and click a button and have it produce those two links automatically? So they could then click Meeting options, set the desired settings then share the join link with students? Then they could just re-use that meeting with their class whenever.

2020-05-07 06:07:23,Set-AutoAttendantAudioFile,"It's a start that I wanted to share.

It doesn't have error handling yet.

Prerequisites:  
1) An auto attendant manually configured in Teams to target (you need its name)  
2) VLC installed  
3) Skype/Lync Online module installed  
4) Voice Recorder in Windows 10 (outputs files in .m4a format) - I can get 3 min recording at 4.3MB in .m4a.  \~256KB per 10 sec in .m4a.  MP3 format about halves the size.  Teams max upload is 5MB.  So maybe a 7 or 8 min recording could be sent up in mp3.    


Use case: You have (a) teams auto attendant(s) and you need to update the audio file that is played at the greeting and you just use the voice recorder app with Windows 10 or iPhone to record the message.  


Next step: Make this an app where a user can upload a file and use a service account in the app, making it so we don't have to give full Teams admin rights for an end-user to update the audio file (and so I don't have to!)  


Idea -- use Zamzar API and put the app in Azure and skip the VLC piece?

    Param (
        $originalAudioFile = ""C:\Sound recordings\Recording (8).m4a"",

Since a couple of days I get the error ""We weren't able to connect. Sign in and we'll try again. Sign in"" in MS Teams. It is an Citrix environment on Server 2016 and on-prem ADFS. Teams is installed with the MSI and ALLUSER ALLUSERS parameters (machine wide install).

I found a post that states that I should enable the  WS-Trust 1.3 windowstransport but that is allready enabled. Also, we did not have this error a week ago. Different versions of Teams, but on all versions this error. There were no changes on Citrix, ADFS or Azure AD that I know of what could cause this error.  
When I click on the Sign in button in the error, our ADFS login form is shown with my UPN prefilled and I need to put in my password. After that, Teams logs in and the error is gone.. When I logout and in, again this error.

In the Teams log I found an error with SSO:  


This line is stating SSO is enabled:  
SSO status: isSsoEnabled: true, enableSsoSetting: true, appConfig: true, disableSsoCommandLine: false  


These are the SSO errors:

User Impact: Users may have incoming calls intermittently dropped upon answering.

More info: Teams iOS client 2.0.9 has been identified as the problematic build. Users operating a previous client version will not experience the issue.

Current status: We've identified that the problem causing incoming calls to intermittently drop exists within the Teams iOS client build 2.0.9. We're validating a fixed version of this build for release to the iOS app store and we encourage users to refrain from updating to the current version of the app until the new version is released tomorrow.

Scope of impact: Your organization is affected by this event. Impact is specific to users that are signed into Teams on the affected iOS build, and any other Microsoft Teams endpoint simultaneously.

Root cause: A recent Teams iOS client build update contained a change to a component that facilitates calls made to users with multiple endpoints. The change is causing incoming calls to be intermittently dropped upon answering. The issue is present in only the Teams iOS client build 2.0.9.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gf5ia7/psa_teams_209_on_ios_users_may_have_incoming/,AriHD

&amp;#x200B;

So a group of users have a private team and have created a number of private channels. One of the owners of the Team got confused as to what they were doing and accidentally removed \~6 users from the team. Unfortunately some of those private channels therefore had all of the members removed so no owner or members left.

We've been asked if we can reclaim access to these channels and I've hit a roadblock. I've tried following the guidance from Microsoft around using PowerShell to add an owner but this seems to only work if there is an existing owner to the channel. I've also tried the Graph route but have had no luck there either.

(tl;dr at the end)

Teacher here. My school is using Teams for homeschooling during the pandemic at the moment. We have an education account at our school which grants us local installs of the apps, but I don‘t know which plan exactly.

Today something very strange happened. I’m using the German version of Teams, so not all terms might be accurate, but I hope you still understand what I’m talking about.

In one of my classes (in which me and 12 fellow teachers are owners), the got the following message:


Admin Test added [Student X] to the team.
Admin Test removed [Student X] from the team.
Admin Test added [Student X] to the team.
Admin Test removed [Student X] from the team.
[My username] added [Student X] to the team.

(Admin Test is the real name, but I won‘t tell you the student‘s or my name.)

I never added the student to the team and I never agreed to a request.

To me, it looks as if my admin tried to add the student to the team, but somehow it didn‘t really work. Then he used my account to do that.

Now here‘s the question: How can that happen? Can admins use user accounts without their knowledge or consent? Does Teams do something in the background that could automatically insert my user name here?

Thanks for your help!

Best wishes

We always planned to migrate entirely to Microsoft Teams somewhere in 2020/2021 but never really used Teams generally outside of a few POC groups and the IT Team. Now with COVID-19, that has all changed.

We are continuing to use SfB as our telephony platform ( phone calls, voicemail and general IM ) for now. We have very recently decided to promote the use of Teams for meetings, collaboration and client calls.

tl;dr: Have SfB on-prem. Have Teams. Is there a way to sync the presence between the two? i.e. if I am on a call in Skype, can we get teams to reflect same and vice-versa?

2020-05-11 21:26:23,Searching for external contacts in the Teams Search Bar,"Hi all, 

I would try to understand the mechanics behinds the contact search in Teams (through the search bar at the top).

Searching for contacts in the Teams search bar by name works well for people in my organization. If the contact is an external ""*Guest*"", it's sometimes more difficult to find him.

I use two ways to invite external people to my tenant : 

* Directly from the AAD (create a new *Guest*, etc.)
* From a Teams team (which will create a *Guest* account on the ADD)

I notice that when a *guest* user is available in a team on my tenant, I can search him from the Teams search bar. That way I can quickly call it up, start a chat, etc.

By cons, when a *guest* user is not in a team or chat but only present in the AAD, I can not find him from the Teams search bar. The only way I can contact him is to add him from the Calls application (with Add speed dial).

I can also create a fictitious team and put all the *guest* users in ... but obviously, this is not a good solution.

If anyone has ever looked for information on this, or have they asked themselves? I will be delighted to exchange on this subject! And if it is still possible to search for **all** the users present on the tenant (internal and external). I'll take the solution :)

Does anyone know how to hide or block Outlook/O365 shared accounts from appearing in Teams?

Our  IT account is set as a shared mailbox where users send help requests, but now they keep trying to contact us via the IT account in  Teams, which doesn't even have an active Teams account to begin with.  It's an unlicensed account in O365, so I'm not sure how it's activated for Teams in the first place. There are no apps showing up for the account under the admin center to enable/disable.

And I get that Teams and Outlook share the same global address list, but I don't think hiding the account from the GAL is the way to go as hiding it in Teams also does the same for Outlook. Not that would be hard for people to type in IT, but let's face it, users always complain. Plus, there are a ton of other shared accounts that have longer names and I envision implementing whatever solution comes up for all the shared accounts.

Frustrating for both us and our users as they think they're reaching out for help, but not getting a hold of us.

The company that I work for has been making the switch to Microsoft Teams and are running into some issues with the video meetings. We have instructed everyone to use the App instead of the web browser. When we invite guests to the meeting and they join, some are unable to view the sidebar menu (Activity, Chat, Teams, Calendar, etc) during the call. This has been posing a problem because we want to add Breakout Sessions where we create smaller groups within the larger group. When the smaller meetings are ready to go, the members without the sidebar are unable to join the Breakout Sessions without leaving the main meeting. Would anybody have some insight on why this may be the case and how we can make sure the sidebar is available to guests during the meetings?

I don't really want to replace the file - Maybe I am then changing screenshots I have previously sent?

So, I click ""keep both"" and then apparently Teams tries to rename the file from ""screenshot.png to screenshot (1).png. Then I get another popup: ""This file already exists"", again with the same options (replace/keep both). This goes on until it finds a file name that doesn't yet exist, e.g. ""screenshot (20).png"".

Pretty new to Teams here. I am wondering if it is possible in a teams channel to put a link in the ""files"" tab or some type of other tab (I don't know what type) to a specific folder that exists on a another teams/sharepoint location?

I have figured out a way to link to the main library/directory of another teams SharePoint/team library but not how to narrow it down to just a specific folder. In the image provided I wish I could link to just the specific highlighted folder instead of to the main directory which is ""Lexington Office\_Documents"".

Is this possible someway? Would I have to use ""Power Automate/flow"", is it even possible in that?

2020-05-14 04:52:03,Thoughts on inviting clients/customers as guests?,"Sorry for this wall of text. Anyways, here I go.

The company I work for has been looking into a way of communicating with our current customers and providing them with information around the process as we are working on the end product. As the customer is usually very involved during the whole process, it's important that the company can post pictures, documents etc. as we are working on the end product.

We've been thinking that we might be able to do this very easily through Teams. Especially considering so many have recently been getting introduced and used to Teams, more of our customers will be familiar with the platform. By creating separate teams with each customer and the employees involved, they can communicate, share documents, make plans in Planner for the customers to complete before the next meeting, make video calls and show the customer the process line and where we currently are with a dynamic timeline through PowerBI are som of the ideas we've had so far.

All this means that we'll have to invite each customer as guests to our tenant and to the team itself. We're used to inviting external users from other companies to our tenant that we are collaborating with, but not customers that are buying our end products. Does anyone have any experiences or thought around doing this? What could be potential issues or disadvantages?

I'm aware of the maximum number of guest limited to 1:5 number of licensed users. E.g. if we have 750 licensed users in our tenant, we can maximum have 750 x 5 = 3750 guest users (which could a possible scenario eventually). I'm also aware that the Power BI part might not be possible due to licensing, and that we would not want to buy licenses for guests to view reports (if that's even possible). Another disadvantage seems to be that there are really no way to customize how the Teams client looks and the invites the guests are receiving when they're invited to the tenant and team (the guests receive two separate emails). In a perfect world we'd like to change some colors in the Teams client, change the text in the invite emails etc, but that doesn't seem to be possible as of now.

2020-05-15 00:47:46,Teams Business Voice Call Latency,"Teams call latency is waaaay better than we were getting with our previous VOIP provider (Mitel) but I still felt it was a bit worse than PSTN-&gt;PSTN calling. I grabbed an audio recorder and audio editing software and did some testing to see what the actual mouth to ear latency was.

* **PSTN (Bell Canada Cell Network) to Windows (Teams): 450ms**
* **Windows (Teams) to PSTN (Bell Canada Cell Network): 630ms**
* **Total round trip: 1080ms**

For reference, the general accepted round trip latency limit for decent call quality is 300ms ( [https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-latency-and-how-it-can-be-reduced-3426314](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-latency-and-how-it-can-be-reduced-3426314),  [https://getvoip.com/blog/2018/12/20/acceptable-jitter-latency/](https://getvoip.com/blog/2018/12/20/acceptable-jitter-latency/) )

So 1080ms leaves something to be desired. It's workable but I still find parties interrupting each other on calls fairly often. I didn't test PSTN-&gt;PSTN but I'm sure it will be much lower.

For reference, my Windows desktop is on a gigabit fiber internet connection with 4ms latency to Google DNS servers. At the time of testing there was very little utilization of my internet link.

It will be interesting to see if this number improves as MS scales up capacity to deal with the onslaught of coronavirus-caused demand.",1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gjq113/teams_business_voice_call_latency/,davegravy

2020-05-15 02:34:02,"Sharing PPT in Teams only shows recent presentations if it was opened on the web, vs PowerPoint desktop, any workarounds?","I've noticed that if I have a PowerPoint open in PowerPoint for Mac and the file is shared on SharePoint, when I then have a Teams call and hit share, the PowerPoint does not show up under recent presentations.  I have to click Browse, then click Teams, then the proper team, then General, then Customers folder, then browse for the customer, pick the presentation and then it streams it.  This is even if the presentation is open in PowerPoint at the same time.

However, if I open the presentation on the web in PowerPoint via Chrome or Edge, when I go to Teams and hit present, it always shows it as a recent one.

So for the past month since switching to Teams, I always start a call with just myself first so that I can take my time browsing for it, as that way when I then am on a call with the customer it DOES show up under recent.  Are there any tricks or tips to make it appear when using PowerPoint desktop?  Not the end of the world but it takes a solid minute to find it if you join with the customer and didn't open it first, which of course always feels more like 5 when you have a customer on video watching waiting for you to finally share it!",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gjs4ag/sharing_ppt_in_teams_only_shows_recent/,psykobunnyto

2020-05-15 02:57:20,Mass Policy Assignment via Powershell,"Hi all,

I wrote up an email to a mailing list for my industry, but figured that the content might be appreciated here!

At work we've been assigning policies en-masse to thousands of users, and have been utilizing Powershell to do it. We're assigning users via the New-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperations cmdlet, and then going over those that fail and manually granting afterwards.

We'd use the New-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation cmdlet like so:

    # In this case we’re using a service account without MFA, however you might find that
    # omitting the -Credential flag gives you better results
    Connect-AzureAD -Credential $Credential | Out-Null
    Connect-MicrosoftTeams -Credential $Credential | Out-Null
    # Clear out any old sessions we have already.
    Get-PSSession | Where-Object Name -like ""SfBPowerShellSession_*"" | Remove-PSSession 
    Import-PSSession $(New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $Credential) -AllowClobber | Out-Null

    # A dynamic group with rules set up for our staff using extensionAttributeXX.
    $AllStaffGroup = Get-AzureADGroup -SearchString ""All Staff""
    # Get all of the AzureAD users in a group.
    $AllStaff = ($AllStaffGroup | Get-AzureADGroupMember -All $true).ObjectID
    # Translate the AzureAD users into CsUsers, useful for checking policies.
    $AllCSStaff = $AllStaff | Get-CsOnlineUser
    # Get rid of any staff that already have the policy, just to ease the strain on Microsoft.
    $AllCSStaffNoMeetingPolicy = $AllCSStaff | Where-Object TeamsMeetingPolicy -ne ""Staff Meeting Policy""

    $BatchOperationParameters = {
      PolicyType = TeamsMeetingPolicy 
      PolicyName = ""Staff Meeting Policy""
      # This takes an array of ObjectIDs or UserPrincipalNames,
      # I'm doing the latter as it's easer to look at
      Identity = $AllCSStaffNoMeetingPolicy.UserPrincipalName
      
      # In my case I’m just giving them a fairly descriptive name that
      # describes exactly what is being done at a glance.
      OperationName = ""batch-assign_staff-meeting-policy_2020-05-13""
    }

    New-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation @BatchOperationParameters

Then you wait. You can check up on Batch Policy Assignments with Get-CsBatchPolicyAssignment, and filter using the -OperationID flag.

In my experience the process can take minutes to hours, however the cmdlet is almost always takes a few  hours to actually update with the real time. Here’s an example:

    &gt; Get-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation -OperationId ""xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"" | Format-List
    OperationId    : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    OperationName  : batch-assign_staff-calling-policy_2020-05-13
    OverallStatus  : Completed
    CreatedTime    : 2020-05-13 10:20:28
    CreatedBy      : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    CompletedTime  : 2020-05-13 10:27:08
    CompletedCount : 7314
    ErrorCount     : 82
    PendingCount   : 0
    UserState      : {xxxx@domain.com, xxxx@domain.com, xxxx@domain.com, xxxx@domain.com...}

As you can see, it only too 7 minutes to do 7.3k users, however it took about 3-4 hours for that to actually show up in the cmdlet. You can also get the UserState property to filter through who failed on a batch: (Get all completed users where they’re not successful)

    &gt; (Get-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation -OperationId ""xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"").UserState
        | Where-Object State -eq ""Completed""
        | Where-Object Result -ne ""Success""

Finally, you can use either the above list or do another query (The $AllCSStaffNoMeetingPolicy command again from earlier) to grant that policy to those users that were struggling:

    foreach($User in $AllCSStaffNoMeetingPolicy) {
      Grant-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity $User -PolicyName ""Staff Meeting Policy""
    }


One snag we did run into is some users kept getting errors regardless of us trying to grant permissions, both via CLI and the website.

One ticket to Microsoft Support later, and I figured out that these were some users that were still on our on-premise Skype for Business system, and therefore had accounts that looked like this:

    &gt; (Get-CsOnlineUser -Identity UserOnSFBOnPrem@domain.com).TeamsUpgradeEffectiveMode
    Islands

    &gt; (Get-CsOnlineUser -Identity UserOnSFBOnPrem@domain.com).TeamsUpgradeEffectiveMode
    TeamsOnly

One final issue that we also ran into was that once you kick off a batch, there does not seem to be a way to cancel it! Maybe I just missed something in the docs, but if I didn’t then you’re stuck if you accidentally ran the policy against the wrong user set. You’d need to loop through all the users you ran updates against and roll them back, however I’m not too sure how you’d get what their policy was before you ran the script? The only damage this caused us was I accidentally ran the same batch twice, but luckily it was only on a few users so there was little damage dealt.

Anywho, hope this was useful to someone!

2020-05-15 03:56:34,Bit of a technical/practical question,"Hi guys, got a question about teams.

&amp;#x200B;

We use a cloudserver (via Microsoft RDP) to login on our digital server at work.

On there we have Outlook, from which we can send Microsoft teams call-invites to clients.

Because we don't want our cloudserver to handle all our videocalls (bandwidth and speed issues if lots of people are on it at the same time), we call on our local laptop (i.e. by minimizing the cloudserver).

Is there a possibility to easily join with a logged in Teams account on the local laptop, on an invite sent by the cloud-outlook? In this example, Outlook (or any email) isn't configured on the local laptop so there's no 'join call' reminder button as you would get in the cloud.

The only way I found is to just copy the invite-url (from sent messages), or CC yourself and join in, but since not many people have local email configured, the latter isn't really an option.Teams and Outlook calendars/agendas are **not** synched on purpose.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gjtq6s/bit_of_a_technicalpractical_question/,makethemoonglow

Is there a beta program I can enroll a subset of users into? (or the tenant as we're not using Teams at the moment)

I can see that you can set the targeted update ring for users in Office365 - but I don't believe this applies to Teams.

Any help would be much appreciated!

2020-05-18 09:31:05,Bluetooth earbuds keep disconnecting. Any fix?,"I just got some Pixel Buds, partially for Teams meetings given my company has moved to WFH. The buds work everywhere flawlessly, even connecting to my PC (Dell XPS, Windows 10). I can listen to music for hours without disconnecting. When I'm using Teams though, it seems to disconnect roughly every 15 minutes.

When it disconnects, I just have to switch to PC mic/speaker, and then back to the Pixel Buds, and it's fine again. During this time, the computer still says it's connected to the buds, and I can still listen to music fine, so it seems entirely related to Teams. I've asked some coworkers, and they've stopped using their Airpods because of this, so it doesn't seem to just be the Pixel Buds either.

This quite a simple solution that will be an additional layer between Teams and users. Idea is to create all-new teams through this app.

If you want to clear MS Teams cache,you could refer to the following ways

1.  Fully exit the Microsoft Teams desktop client. To do this, either right click Teams from the Icon Tray and select ‘Quit’, or run Task Manager and fully kill the process.

2.  Go to File Explorer, and type in %appdata%\Microsoft\teams.

 3.  Once in the directory, you’ll see a few of the following folders:

* From within ‘Application Cache’, go to Cache and delete any of the files in the Cache location. %appdata%\Microsoft\teams\application cache\cache

* From within ‘Blob_storage’, delete any files that are located in here if any. %appdata%\Microsoft\teams\blob_storage

* From within ‘Cache’, delete all files. %appdata%\Microsoft\teams\Cache

* From within ‘databases’, delete all files. %appdata%\Microsoft\teams\databases

* From within ‘GPUCache’, delete all files. %appdata%\Microsoft\teams\GPUcache

* From within ‘IndexedDB’, delete the .db file. %appdata%\Microsoft\teams\IndexedDB

* From within ‘Local Storage’, delete all files. %appdata%\Microsoft\teams\Local Storage

 * Lastly, from within ‘tmp’, delete any file. %appdata%\Microsoft\teams\tmp

Microsoft support keeps insisting that I should go to addins and enable the Teams-addin, so not much help from there yet.

quick question, maybe one of you has an idea for my issue.

Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

In Windows Server (any version, with any VDA 1906.2 or higher), session disconnect/reconnect might result in Teams failing to load in optimized mode (""Citrix HDX Not Connected"" in About/Version). Citrix and Microsoft are aware of this issue and are rolling out the fix, deployed already in [Ring 3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2015/08/12/managing-office-365-updates/). This will not require any component upgrade (Teams, VDA or Workspace app) and is rolled out via feature flags (sign out/sign in required). In some scenarios, attempting to make a call will trigger Teams to try to reconnect to the Citrix services and optimization will succeed. \[RFWIN-15624\] \[Microsoft Teams Bug ID: 873138\]",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gri3rw/microsoft_teams_bug_how_to_view_progress/,danieldunn10

2020-05-27 21:24:00,Teams not honouring Global Protect Split Tunnel (Occasionally..),"Has anyone else had this, we have 50G+ of firewall traffic for Teams despite split tunnelling the optimised IP ranges. Wireshark confirms that most of the time traffic goes straight out and then sometimes traffic decides to go down the VPN tunnel, this can happen on the same device, connected to the same VPN gateway on the same day! This is all I found:  


\---------

## Configuring and securing Teams media traffic

Some administrators may require more detailed information on how call flows operate in Teams using a split tunneling model and how connections are secured.

### Configuration

For both calls and meetings, as long as the required Optimize IP subnets for Teams media are correctly in place in the route table, when Teams calls the *GetBestRoute* method to determine which interface it should use for a particular destination, the local interface will be returned for Microsoft destinations in the Microsoft IP blocks listed above.

Some VPN client software allows routing manipulation based on URL. However, Teams media traffic has no URL associated with it, so control of routing for this traffic must be done using IP subnets.

In certain scenarios, often unrelated to Teams client configuration, media traffic still traverses the VPN tunnel even with the correct routes in place. If you encounter this scenario then using a firewall rule to block the Teams IP subnets or ports from using the VPN should suffice.

**Note**

A current requirement for this to work in 100% of scenarios is to also add the IP range **13.107.60.1/32**. This should not be necessary very shortly due to an update in the Teams client due for release by **June 2020**. We will update this article with the build details as soon as this information is available.

Signalling traffic is performed over HTTPS and is not as latency sensitive as the media traffic and is marked as **Allow** in the URL/IP data and thus can safely be routed through the VPN client if desired.

\--------

I don't really want to block these subnets/ports on the firewall if I can help it for Global Protect users if there is another fix that can be put in place, has anyone encountered this?

We migrated to Office 365 in 2018, but chose the video conferencing solution that was in place with our VOIP platform instead of moving to Teams.  Recently, with WFH taking off for our company, we decided to re-evaluate our Video Conferencing solution.  

We like many of the features that Teams offers, however, our current VOIP provider includes a phone number for each meeting as an alternative join option (along with the video conference).  It seems Microsoft does not offer this as part of the package.

We have Microsoft 365 E3 licenses for every user in our company.  I am being told that we need to upgrade to Microsoft 365 E5 licenses to get the audio conferencing feature in Teams.  This is estimated to cost over $50k/year in additional costs. 

We already have a VOIP provider that we are happy with.  Do we have any other option to get audio for MS Teams Meetings other than upgrading everyone from E3 to E5 licenses?

Is there a way to do this? I understand that Google Docs are not strictly documents so there may be some difficulty in migrating them to One Drive/Teams.

So we all know how the pandemic has screwed everything up for us. Naturally, in such a scenario, MS Teams is proving to be a great tool for everyone. However i wanna know some of the things about Teams since I haven't actually used it before.


I'm a college undergrad student. My college decided to conduct our classes online. They chose MS Teams and setup accounts for all the students by using our college email IDs. Professors set up different teams for different courses and put all the students in their course teams. The professors, in most cases, are the sole owner of the teams.


I wanna know how private the chats actually are and who can (if they can) read the private chats between two group members, which in this case would be, say, 2 of the classmates, just chatting casually or discussing something related to what is being taught. Can the teachers read their chats? If yes, then is there anyway to avoid it? What else should I know as a student?

I've been looking everywhere for an answer to my problem but as yet haven't found one so I'm coming to Reddit for possible solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

# Issue:

&amp;#x200B;

When scheduling a meeting from within Teams the meeting invite will ONLY successfully go out to people not on my domain. Anyone from within my domain does not get the invite. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What I've tried:**

I've gone through the normal stuff. Checking junk mail rules and making sure our domain isn't blocked for some reason. Adding our domain to the ""safe senders"" list. And there's no difference. When I test the meeting scheduler the invite goes out, but only people with an external domain (ie guests) receive the invite.

&amp;#x200B;

**Workaround I've been forced to use:**

I'm able to create a meeting from within Outlook for Teams, but functionally it is vastly inferior as I have to select each individual email address to add to the meeting. Now if I setup a meeting in this way, invites do go out to people on my domain. 

&amp;#x200B;

# What I'd like:

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be able to schedule a meeting from within Teams so that everyone, whether on my domain or otherwise, can receive the invite automatically. It seems like a simple request but I've come up against a wall thus far.

2020-06-02 06:54:35,Are Volume Settings Still a Mess?,"Hello,

I've been using Teams for a while now. I've always had issues with the volume settings, both in calls and notifications.

&amp;#x200B;

When I join a call it seems to reset my call volume settings to default. This causes volume to start coming thru my (closed) laptop, even though I use my phone for audio. So, every-single-time I start a teams call I have delay for a moment to fix the double-audio and resulting echo.

&amp;#x200B;

These audio settings that are available in the call, are not accessible outside the call. It's like there are a bunch of different cog wheels (the 'settings' buttons) that all lead to different places.

&amp;#x200B;

There seems to be no volume or notification settings. Yet, somehow my video call settings seem to affect these audio settings because after I lower my laptop audio in a call I know longer seem to have chat/notification volume. And I can't seem to change this after leaving the call. So, I've missed/had a delayed response for numerous messages simply because I have no idea I'm even getting them.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether or not I get notification audio also seems to be dependent on other factors, such as minimizing the app or not.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I'm not sure on  the causes for all of this. All I know is, the volume controls on Teams are a mess. They've been a mess for months. I can find loads of people reporting it online.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, no fix. Correct? Or did I somehow miss it?

&amp;#x200B;

Guess Microsoft is too busy making sure they air a Microsoft Teams advertisement every other commercial slot.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Will Teams volume controls ever be fixed?

2020-06-02 09:09:13,Migration from Skype Server to Teams Advice Needed,"Hi all, looking for advice from others who have done this.

Current Situation:

We have been asked to roll out Teams meetings for the company. We are a global manuf company of about 4000.

We have Skype on premise for Enterprise voice for 1500 users, and Skype on premise for meetings and chat for all 4000. The other voice users are Avaya and a mix of older solutions.The original plan in 2019 was a full migration of voice and meetings to standardize on Teams as our entire platform. For this to happen we need to invest a decent amount of money,and at this time it does not seem likely in the near future. Until recently the plan was to stick with Skype long term and then migrate to Teams at a later date. Now leadership is looking for Teams Meetings to be rolled out in the very near future.

Sadly i inherited a bit of an unplanned mess, and Teams was rolled out to users before we could lock things down to much. Due to this we average 2500 chat messages a day in Teams, and are in Islands mode. ( Meetings and calling are disabled via policy) 

From my experience and my research Islands mode is a bit of a mess, with the biggest problem being two independent clients thus a poor user experience. The logical first step according to Microsoft is  SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings  , but this disables chat, and since we have 2500 chats a day that is a impossible switch. This really leaves us with Islands mode from my point of view, because we are no where near ready for TeamsOnly Mode.   

I would love any advice on how to move forward and deliver Teams Meetings, without making the experience worse. My guy says Islands mode will need to be the solution, and we ddo have about 40 users in a POC within Islands mode who have not complained, but I also realize Islands mode puts a lot of responsibility on the end user and is the ""lazyadmin"" way",1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/guxf05/migration_from_skype_server_to_teams_advice_needed/,Pirated_Freeware

I wanted to add the Azure DevOps connector to one of my channels in teams.

We recently went through a rename exercise where we renamed many of our teams to make them easier to work with. Most name changes were pretty minor - from ""HR"" to ""Head Office HR"", for example. We did not make any changes in SPO as part of the rename - only the team name in the Teams management console. 

The only issue we've run into is when someone syncs a team folder to their computer, the folder appears with the old name (so, for example, the team above would sync as ""HR- General"").

Anyone know where this comes from and if I can update the name of synced folders?",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gvax3c/how_to_update_name_of_synced_folders/,Shanga_Ubone

During that time, the user sees the person's profile image.  There is no audio/video sync issue. Is just that the delay in when the video appears or Teams activates the camera to appear.

We use O365, and Teams is already included in our licenses, but we don’t use it much.  I’ve used it at a prior company, again only internally, but I loved it. 

How is it for users outside the organization, our patients in this case? Can we easily send them links to video meetings? Do they need to download the app, or can they join through browser on laptop/desktop? What about on mobile, I’m assuming app required? Will they be promoted for an MS account, or can they just join the meeting?

The prevalent solution I've read about is to use the Q&amp;A feature to allow participants to cast their vote, and I suppose that'd work well enough, but for the event I'm involved in we have potentially 4000 participants which could get very busy when casting votes.

To complicate things even more, a large portion of the participants are older and not very IT-savvy. This means that asking them to open a new browser tab and taking part in an external poll will most likely not only fail but probably leave them with a bad experience from the event in general.

The event is to be held in a month so maybe, just maybe, Microsoft will implement this until then but I'd rather not have that as my Plan A. :)",1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/gyulvx/best_way_to_do_voting_in_a_live_events/,MartinNr1

* Polycom CCX hardware is by far the best Teams phone, but lack of BTOE or any option to connect to PC makes it not as good experience as VVX with BTOE. Apparently BTOE is coming. 
* Contacts sync is broken for many users.  In Call tab&gt; Contacts, it is supposed to bring your entire Outlook contacts library.  We have found that for 5% of the organization this function is broken with no solutions to fix from MS.
* Delays on Call Queue Pickup.  There is a known issue of a 2-5 second delay on picking up a call from a call queue.  The work around we found is creating users that acts as hunt groups via call delegation.  Apparently this is fixed this week, but haven't tested on all devices.
* Resource Accounts can sometimes be finicky assigning numbers, and you have to delete and recreate.

2020-06-08 22:51:20,No Numbers found trying to assign service # to auto attendant,"We are using teams for our new business for all our phone needs - it's 100% Voip and been working great for months. We need to set up a general office number, linked to an auto attendant and I've now hit a hug snag. 

We are all using Business voice (due to the covid-19 issue the free trial has been extended from initial 30 days for another 60, so we are still on the free trial version - I'm hoping that is not the issue) 

I've gone through and set everything up accordingly to assign a phone number to the auto attendant for the resource account that I've created but it continuously tells me that no phone numbers can be found. I currently have 20 unassigned service numbers. It's been 2 weeks of daily attempts without success, so it seems unlikely the issue is the latency (upwards of 24 hours) between Microsoft and teams. 

 I have tried license variants (I have 3 resource account set up for testing this now, one to try call queues, and 2 for auto attendant - 1 with the virtual user and 1 with a full office and voice paid license) to no avail. I have 2 auto attendants set up now too for testing, one with a user as oper and one without an operator. I've tried altering the way the auto attendants are set up in general... Nothing. I'm really stuck.
I occasionally see a message from Microsoft that says it cannot access phone numbers at this time but it only happens occasionally.
I'm truly wondering if this is Microsoft having a problem or if I'm doing something wrong.
Does anyone have any solutions or suggestions??!

The only thing I can find online that might help, that had worked for others is certain powershell directions and I have only basic powershell knowledge... And the few attempts I made with it haven't done anything successful. I've noticed that it a few people tried Microsoft help tickets but that didn't  produced much success. also see people talking about the sfb admin Center but does that really work for teams-e never set up or  used Skype on our new system it's all been teams from day one....seems unlikely to help....

We installed Microsoft Teams MSI during our task sequence to create a golden image for non persistent vdi setup.

&amp;#x200B;

We tried things like:

Change registry value Teams in "" HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run""  from ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Teams\\current\\Teams.exe"" to ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Teams\\current\\Teams.exe"" –process-start-args ""–system-initiated"". (Suggested in comments, Teams still opens normal on logon).

&amp;#x200B;

Run the following PS Script to edit the user tickbox ""Open as hidden"" in teams, manually setting the button doesn't matter either.

2020-06-10 21:16:14,Planner inside of Channels.,"Currently our organization is moving from Skype for Business to Teams so we are all learning the in's and out's of what Microsoft Teams can do.  We have our Team under one umbrella team and then we have different channels for different areas.  For example, we have a budget channel, a reporting channel, etc.  This allows our internal to the organization people to access the main team and find the information that they are needing in a channel.  Is there any plan to have Planner be able to be installed in a channel?  Our channels are all private channels so that we can keep some information private to those that do not need to see or are not supposed to see those areas.  Having Planner under just the main channel would mean that everyone that has access to the main team, will see our planner, while we would much prefer to keep the Planner available to a much smaller, private group.  

quick pic of how we set up our team.  Any help or ideas would be appreciated.

2020-06-11 11:31:54,Quirks with Joining Meetings &amp; Teams Room,"Hi All,

We've noticed some unusual behaviour with joining meetings from external contacts on MTR system.

If we forward the meeting invite to the room account or if the external person invites the room, we're seeing the meeting show up on the MTR console, but not as a Teams meeting so we can't join it.

Also if we go to join the meeting on a Desktop or iOS device, we don't get the meeting options page (join with video etc) nor do we get the option to invite a nearby room.

Some external meetings work fine and some don't. These are all coming from the same external organisation. Internal meetings seem to work fine.

The room account is set up to auto accept meeting requests, not to delete comments, to allow external domains to email the account and to accept conflicts. 

Proximity join is enabled etc. 

Wondering if anyone has seen similar issues lately or can shed any light on things.

2020-06-11 16:13:49,Why does teams create SharePoint?,"Hi guys, I'm trying to get my head around Teams. So every Team creates an entirely new SharePoint site with its own folder structure. And every private channel creates its own SharePoint site with its own folder structure. And when a Team is removed, its files and folders are deleted. Which means in short order, any attempt to create a consistent, organised folder structure on SharePoint will fail, with a seeming recipe for chaos, and files and folders can just disappear as teams come and go. I am absolutely baffled as to why Microsoft decided on that approach. Surely it makes more sense to leave Teams and SharePoint as separate entities, and then allow users to connect them when relevant? Am I missing something? Currently deciding whether to go all in on Teams but this is really throwing me. I look at Slack, with voluntary integration with office 365, and it makes more sense to me, even though it's from a different company.

2020-06-13 00:18:08,Looking for the best way to invite users from across the org to a channel or team,"Hi Teams Community!  
 

I have a strange question, and it’s a tad complicated to explain, so I’ll try to keep it quick!

To my knowledge, there seem to be two ways to invite people to your channel or team:  
 

* **For channels:** a share URL 
* **For teams**: a join code  
 

In short, I want to invite users from across our organization to a channel or a team so they can participate in a Q &amp; A **(we don’t yet have Live Events!).**  
 

As of right now, we created a channel, and the channel allows us to send a LINK invite (basically just a long URL) that brings people to the channel. 

This works for some users, but others are reporting that Teams is prompting them to enter a code. Does anyone know why some users would be taken straight to the channel and others asked to input a code?  


To phrase it another way, I want a member of our leadership to be able to send an email to staff that says “Hey, come join me for a question and answer session. To participate, simply:   


1) click this URL link, or  
2) input this join code\`\`

In your opinion, which option should I use? Is it easiest to just invite people to a team via a teams code ?  or should I stick with the channel url ?  

If anything is unclear, please let me know and I’ll try to explain better!

2020-06-13 06:10:06,Teams Direct Routing and unassigned numbers,"Just in case this helps anyone else out...

Quick background: Business has been running phone system in Teams via Direct Routing for some time now using an AudioCodes SBC. Business has asked about implementing a method for handling unassigned numbers instead of the generic 'number not in service' callers hear from their carrier when the 404 not found message gets sent back. There's a couple uservoice ideas on this, but not many votes yet.

My solution, keep in mind this is using the AudioCodes SBC in a Direct Routing setup. Keep in mind all the following takes place on the SBC:

1 - Add 404 to SBC &gt; Routing &gt; Alternative Routing Reasons

2 - Create IP Group that functionally duplicates your current Teams IP Group, give it a meaningful name, such as Alt-Teams. You can re-use the same IP profile, proxy set, etc. (You'll see the reason for this IP Group in step 4.)

3 - In IP-to-IP routing, add a route directly below current routing sending to Teams, but in this route use the 'Alternative Route Ignore Inputs' and set the destination IP Group to the new IP Group created in step 2.

4 - In SBC &gt; Manipulation &gt; Outbound Manipulations, create an entry that re-writes the destination URI, replacing the original called number with the number of your unassigned number destination (receptionist, auto-attendant, etc). Setup the matching rules as needed making sure the IP Group is what you created in step 2.

5 - Place a test call and make sure it works.",1.0,7.0,0.89,1.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/h7u9tx/teams_direct_routing_and_unassigned_numbers/,Wires_Everywhere

2020-06-14 05:52:11,Some has already set up Teams for your organization,"I've been having this issue since the first day I wanted to create free Teams accounts for our company users (*ourcompany.com* domain email). We **do not have** Office/Microsoft 365 subscriptions of **any** kind.  We ***did have*** a Office E3 trial years ago that we never fully implemented (domain was always *ourcompany.onmicrosoft.com*)

Long story short, I can create Microsoft Accounts using our company email addresses, but I cannot add them to Teams. Every single one shows the same error. I spent a whole hour with MS support and they couldn't figure this out. It's extremely frustrating, since a lot of our customers are using Teams and would like to have meetings there.

As a workaround, I created new MS accounts for each of our users using the *outlook.com* domain, which seems to be working just fine. It's not ideal as I'd like everyone to have their *name@ourcompany.com* email instead of *name.ourcompany@outlook.com* (I wanted some sort of consistency so everyone has a Teams account like this)

So anyway, I can't find a single straight answer regarding this problem. Is there any way I can investigate further as how our domain is already set up in Teams?

Looking forward to any tips. Thank you!

Tomorrow, I am organising interviews via Teams. If I explain what I've done, could someone just confirm that this is the correct process and my understanding of how this will work is correct?

1. In my calendar, I set up a new meeting
2. I added a title, the times and added in all four participants (it didn't come up with the option to add myself, but I'm assuming that as I'm the one creating it and it's in my calendar this is a default?)
3. I understand that participants now get an email from me with the link and the option to accept/decline.

Tomorrow, am I right in thinking that I can go into the meeting early to greet people? As I didn't get the email inviting me to the meeting (as it's in my calendar and I'm the organiser?), do I just click into the meeting in Teams?

Can I bow out when the interview starts (I am not part of the panel) without ending the meeting? I'm worried that if I leave, it might end the meeting for all other participants - which I definitely don't want! But I also want to be free to greet the next candidate when they arrive a few minutes early. My interviews are currently spaced an hour a part and will run for about 45 minutes - ending about 15 minutes before the next meeting/interview.

2020-06-18 02:42:32,"Using Microsoft Teams on a personal computer for work purposes, what can Teams see?","TLDR: I want to know how much of my home computer Microsoft teams can see and track. 

I work for a non-profit and we've recently been told that we'll be working from home for the foreseeable future and will be switching from Skype to Microsoft Teams since it's supposedly better for remote working. Currently I use a personal computer at home and log in via a remote desktop, I downloaded Teams last week but I was asked to give  my work access and control over my device. I selected no and had to go through this process every time I logged in until one day I was in a hurry and hit OK, after that I went to my browser and saw that I was logged in under my work account even though I was on my personal computer and was already logged in through my personal gmail account. So I uninstalled the program from my computer just to be safe and planned to figure out a secure way to log back in later.

Then, yesterday I switched from Chrome to Bing and noticed that I was somehow logged in under my work email which I have never set up for Bing. I figured the only way I could be logged in was if I was still logged into Microsoft Teams, I ran a search for the app and found that it had auto reinstalled itself and auto logged me in. I realized that you have to uninstall the program and the installer to fully remove the app from your computer. I have no idea how many days I was logged into my Teams account without realizing it and I'm worried that my work can track everything I was doing over the weekend. I'm not doing anything illegal from my computer but it bothers me that my boss could potentially see that I was looking at other job postings even though I was doing this on my own time on my own device. 

I'm also concerned because I have tabs that just stay open sometimes from personal searches and I don't want my employer to think that I spent a whole day shopping for clothes just because I had a tab open from earlier browsing. I brought up my concerns to my boss (he is the type of person that would track my productivity and search history if he could) and asked how much Teams can track in terms of productivity and work but he wouldn't give me a straight answer/ I don't think he even knows the answer. We don't have the budget for me to get a work laptop and I don't have space in my apartment to bring my whole desktop in from the office. I know that anything I do via my remote desktop can be tracked and I understand that if I'm using a work computer, they can install whatever programs they want and I should only use them for work purposes. I also understand that anything I do directly through the Teams App like messaging and meetings can be tracked but this is on my personal computer outside of the App. 

Does anyone know exactly what Microsoft Teams can see and track through your computer? Does it record searches or just give an amount of time spent online? Can it track what other applications are open on my computer? I can't find specific answers anywhere.

TL/DR: **Big IT Departments - how do you keep your Teams/SharePoint environment organized and groomed, and still keep happy customers?**

**I am interested in any of your feedback on two ideas that have been proposed in my IT Dept. to regain control of our Teams/SharePoint that management feels they are losing.**

1. They have proposed the support staff begin *pushing* a Team-per-Department approach, creating Teams for each Department, and then having projects and groups within those Departments each get a channel as needed.  A Department Champion, I guess, would probably then be able to manage provisioning and channel creation.  I believe IT sees themselves creating these Teams up front and then training the Department how to use them (or just letting them know it is there). One of the main purposes of this is to provide landing areas for migrating customer files that currently reside on file shares that management wants to sunset.  These file shares are now difficult for customers to access because many customers won't/can't use onedrive or our vpn.
2. Coupled with #1 they have proposed to drastically restrict the ad hoc creation of new Teams from the previous rate.

Also, what are the risks of having a lot of Teams, where IT staff don't necessarily know how every one is getting used?

**Background:**

I work in a big central IT Department in a huge, centrally located organization.  With Covid going on many people are working remotely.

* We have only 2-3 sysadmins dedicated to our Microsoft messaging and collaboration products.  
* We rolled out Teams in the past year and Covid sent our utilization numbers up to 5,000+ unique active Teams users per day.
* We manage creation of new Teams centrally.  One must open a ticket to get a team created, then there are some dedicated helpdesk staff that have the permission to create them.  The naming scheme for a Team has a long prefix preceding what the customer actually asked the Team to be called

Among management there is this idea that we are creating too many Teams and it is becoming a burden. They believe:

1.  the technical staff is overburdened with requests for new Teams and SharePoint sites as the organization's staff moves from file shares to these platforms.  Mistakes seem to be getting made, mixed messages about the platform and standards are being sent, and requests for Teams are getting fulfilled when the customer didn't really know what he was asking for.   
2. IT staff like the helpdesk and the PMO who are closest to the customers can't sort through all of the Teams and SharePoint sites that are already created to determine whether they can use existing assets to meet a customer request.  Some of these folks are on dozens of Teams, and they feel overwhelmed by it even though their customers are not necessarily complaining",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/hbgi9a/enterprise_it_too_many_teams_problem/,bignoselawnchair

I’m just curious as to what options people went with when addressing the hardware in their meeting rooms when moving to Teams?

We have Trio 8800’s paired with Visual+ and our rooms hold approx. 4-6 people

If we wanted to keep the hardware we would need to purchase the RealConnect license in order for audio and video to work with Teams. I know the RealConnect license can be leveraged across multiple devices, but due to how often they are used we would generally have 1 license per device 

Due to the RealConnect license cost, there seems to be many options from leveraging the Trio with a Poly Studio x30, the x30 + TC8, Yealink vc210 which are around the same price

2020-06-23 00:47:36,yealink teams phone and intune," 

Hey everyone,

Our organization currently uses Office 365 e3 for licensing but we have recently received some yealink teams edition phones we would like to have a few users start using.

It looks like the only way you can use these phones is to have them be managed by intune. When I boot up the phone it basically redirects me to a page on how to set up intune.

What do I need to know to get these couple users able to log into these phones? Is there a one off intune license that I can add on for these couple users to get it working for them? Or is there any way to get them to work without using intune at all? I thought i would be able to just turn on the phone and have the user log in the way they do into teams any other way. I have just about 0 experience with intune but would love to get more familiar with it.

Any information on what I'm getting myself into would be super helpful

When giving control of a PowerPoint to presenter on my second screen I'm unable to control Teams window without affecting presenters control?,"Our organisation has been experimenting with Teams Live events. We've worked around the limitations with an eye on NDI support so I can switch to using OBS with virtual cam. 

However, I've noticed in the last two events we've run when I hand control of a PowerPoint on my second screen (with the producer view on the other screen) if I want to make any changes (change webcam view etc) I will interupt the focus of the presentation, forcing them to click twice on the PowerPoint. Once to regain focus on the PowerPoint, and once more to advance to the next slide. Whilst this isn't an issue if your experienced in this process, it will panic some presenters when their first click appears to do nothing. 

In my first couple of Live events I didn't appear to have this issue, but I was running the PowerPoint in a separate instance (in PowerPoint &gt; Set up Slideshow) on the second screen. I'm away from my machine at present, so I cannot confirm this. Has anybody else noted this?

Going back to OBS, when Teams gains NDI support, what would be the best method to show a presenters screen and allow them to control it?

I do, however, have permission to use OneNote in isolation.

I have watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtMh7dv4H58&amp;t=198s) which explains the process, but I am still unsure of how this looks for students.

Many months ago I followed [the instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-standalone-static-tabs-using-spo-sites) to create an intranet portal in Teams as a custom Teams app. It has been working great, and is very popular at my organization.

Yesterday I updated the app to include a new SPO tab, and now in the updated app none of the pages load- the pages spin for a while in the Teams app and then display ""There was a problem reaching this app"". To test to see if I fat-fingered something during my update (hard to imagine since the only change was adding a new tab), I reverted back to the old version and find the same behavior in the old version as well. Oddly the tabs work fine in the Teams Android app, but not on in the desktop app or on the web.

We also have two other locations involved that don’t need to be on our Teams/Office 365. They just need their own separate line for answering calls.

We use 8x8 VoIP for phone. 
We’ve stuck with 8x8 because it also faxes (which we must have for government compliance) and texts (which clients like). 

I’d only watch to simplify and cut costs. 

Should we switch over to Teams? Do you like it for phone?

I apologize if this question has arisen before, but I had no luck finding anything via search bar.
I work as a Software Project Manager for a large corporation.  My day consists of Teams Meetings after Teams Meetings.  Within these meetings, I take detailed notes of everything that was discussed.  I attempted to utilize the ""meeting notes"" within the meetings, but the formatting options are very basic.  Instead, I have been taking notes via OneNote and just adding the info from the ""Meeting Notes"" tab within OneNote to each note.  This is helpful as it relays the details from Teams into OneNote.  This tells me that there is a one way road of communication between OneNote and MS Teams.  The details from Teams in OneNote but not OneNote details within Teams.  
To my question.... Is there any way to have a OneNote tab within the meeting details (perhaps within the chat screen) that will link my notes into Teams and allow anyone within that team to access these notes (read-only or full access)?  I don't think there is a way, but perhaps someone has found a work-around with MS Flow or perhaps with SharePoint?  
Even with the limiting formatting options within teams, it would still be helpful to my team if I could copy the notes I take in OneNote and paste them into Meeting's notes.  Unfortunately, this isn't possible as Teams will not allow you to paste notes within.

I have looked online to see if there were any help and what I have tried has not worked. I have checked off disable GPU hardware acceleration and deleted items in the folder related to the cache etc...

Not sure how, but one of our team members managed to have the 32-bit version installed on their work-administered PC.  She's been complaining that live captions in meetings isn't available.  Her and I are essentially running the same PCs (only diff is mine has 16GB memory, hers 8).  The IT dept for whatever reason set her up using 32-bit teams instead of 64.

Background: Critical Care Nurse, organization just transitioned to Office 365. I'm using my Team (public) to set up ""Meetings"" linked to a Channel (public) of the Team. Essentially, I am inviting people to join a device training class. I want the event to be public (so anyone can see it's happening and it shows up on out Sharepoint calendar) but I want only those I directly invited (Required Attendee) to receive email notices.

Instead, EVERYONE in the whole darn team is receiving email notices of the events (making it look like they are specifically invited). Is this just a fact of Teams?  Is it behaving as intended and I just have to accept it? Are there settings I can change? The only alternative I can come up with is Private Channels (of which I wouldn't have enough since the limit is 30? We host at least 20-25 educational courses a year) and then all he content would be private. Or A new Team for each class? Which would create a new sharepoint every time..... which I don't want.

Unfortunately, it isn't the easiest  but I am making a go of it.  We decided to migrate all of our phone numbers up to Teams and cut off our side when done.  I have found a few gotchas like; You must remove the user from Lync2013 before the dial pad will show up, etc... 

Traditionally, I will put in a port order and wait for it to get accepted into the system, I then am allowed to apply to the user before it goes live with teams powershell.  

The issue I am having is the ported number will get approved and the phone number will be on the Teams side but it wont ring the user it is applied to.  My CSP told me to remove licensing and reapply licensing (all users e5 with domestic calling plan) and it should all work.  They are kind of right but it has taken hours for the licensing to reapply.  

Does this sound like it should be taking this long? Is this process sound? Does anyone else have a better way of doing this task?

We found that disabling the ""Read Receipts"" option within the Privacy settings of Microsoft Teams massively improved performance!

If you hang up the handset but fumble your hand or maybe rock it as you hang up, the software on the phone locks up (no buttons can be pressed), and it constantly goes from on-the-hook to off-the-hook, back and forth. The only fix is restarting the phone. We are on the latest firmware (1449/1.0.94.2020040801) and have tried restarting the phone. This happens on at least two phones. The issue can also be simulated by simply picking up the handset and pressing the physical hangup button on the phone a few times quickly.

The issue is very reproducible. Does anyone else have experience with this or other phones, or can perhaps test the issue on other makes/models to see if it happens and is a Teams issue in general, and let me know what you think about those models in general?

We didn't realize we needed to purchase an ""Premier Support"" in order to get assistance with this issue from Poly for phones that essentially don't work, which is what we are being told.

2020-07-03 18:30:33,Added Calendar to Team. Trouble editing/deleting list items.,"Hello all, hoping you can help me with this one. I created a calendar by going to the Team (SharePoint) and it behaves pretty much like a normal SharePoint calendar. The only thing that is off is that once an item is created on the calendar, there is no option to edit/delete it, neither from the calendar view, nor from the individual item's view. Only by going to Allitems.aspx can these list items be edited or deleted, but this is hard and cumbersome for our end-users. 

I checked all the permissions. Users have sufficient access (I have full control and have the same issue). In the list advanced settings, users are allowed to edit or delete any item, so that's not it either. Also, since it  can be done from allitems.aspx, I don't think this is so much a permission issue as some sort of UI issue. 

Any idea what the trouble here is?",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/hkgqe6/added_calendar_to_team_trouble_editingdeleting/,Khulod
2020-07-03 19:12:31,Is there a way to create group pings?,"Hi, sorry if this has been asked before. I was scrolling a bit but couldn't find it. Web searches also weren't particularly helpful. 

Our organization uses both Flowdock and MS Teams. The Team I'm working in in particular heavily favors Teams. It's working nicely, but there's one thing missing: Flowdock-Style group pings. In Flowdock, I can create a group such as ""tech"", add all technical people of the team to it and then ping only those people with @@tech if I have a question about a technical issue. 

So far I haven't been able to find an equivalent in MS Teams. It is possible to ping channels, but that doesn't work quite as well, since if you join the tech-channel as a non-tech person - which you may have to do because there's information in there that you need - you'll be included in future tech pings. 

I was hoping that, since MS Teams is part of Microsoft's Office offering, it would have some integration with mailing lists as they're supported in Outlook. I found nothing in regards to that, though.

2020-07-04 23:37:39,Feature Wish: Customized notifications based on channel,"So maybe I'm missing something but I wish Teams would let us set up notifications based on channel.   To give you some ideas why, here are a couple of examples:  


\- I set up a channel for with email address for all my system alerts for outages.   Now I can see them all in a channel and get teams notifications when a new system alert happens.  I can tag other sysadmins on a reply to an alert and we can discuss the outage in a thread on the alert.     What I'd like to be able to do though is have a different sound/notification on that channel.  It would be even cooler if a channel could bypass any DND or silent mode on my phone but that's probably pushing it.  


\- We had an outage and someone on the team hit ""meet now"" on our general channel and was able to instantly call the team together to alert everyone about the outage and discuss next steps.   What would be really nice is if team calls could have a different ring tone based on channel or group chat.   In that case I'd change the ringtone on the above alerts channel and then if there was an outage someone looking at the post in the channel could hit the ""meet now"" button and call the team together and we'd have a different ring tone so we'd know it wasn't just a person to person call and ignore it on a Saturday afternoon.    


Anyway, I imagine I might be able to do some of this by layering on other tech like flow but I thought I'd throw this idea out there.  I could also see it being useful to ""all call"" a team together in other situations like a non-IT disaster in say a municipal setting.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/hl59g2/feature_wish_customized_notifications_based_on/,mrcpu

Good afternoon,

I am an infrastructure manager for a trust of schools and have recently ran into the following issue:

Previously we have had **Anonymous users can join a meeting turned on**, this has allowed our heads to have meetings with non registered parents, or teachers to make safeguarding calls to parents via teams.

Due to covid we host classrooms and live lessons, this are communicated with the teams via a meeting invite (with the clickable join meeting link)

Students have began sharing that link and then joining the meeting as an anonymous user chrome incognito or similar. They are made to wait in the lobby but unfortunately any student in that meeting has the ability to allow them in.

We cant cancel the anonymous user facility because of safeguarding and parent calls, but we cant allow the students to join lessons in anonymous mode.

Is there a config that would allow both?

We're a non-profit and we collaborate extensively with lots of external users. One annoying thing that has come up is when we add an external user to a team, they need to switch between organizations beside their user bubble in the top right of Teams in order to access teams from our org (see attached image). That in itself isn't so bad, but what is *really bad* is that they don't even receive notifications about what's happening in the Teams and Channels from our organization unless they manually switch orgs. Is there a way to receive notifications from all organizations that you have Teams with without needing to switch first?

I ask this because something happened in my university during an exam:

So, I am curious to know how this came through. One theory from a friend of mine who's also in university in computer science says it might be because of Microsoft Teams:

\- The cheaters were using Microsoft Teams to exchange responses with each other and the teacher noticed this somehow.

So, knowing that the cheaters were using MT to talk, is it possible for the teacher to know this? I am asking because we, as students, need to be logged in to Office 365 with our university's e-mail. So, I think it would be plausible for the teacher to know.

2020-07-10 16:30:30,Im having a massive amount of trouble understanding teams.,"Right, this will probably be a one time post to this subreddit, as I only got this to join a singular school meeting.

1 - I can't use the office 365 application to join my schools team meeting, as my college has blocked new 365 applications.

2 - I created a business account just to sign up to this bullshit just so i wouldn't be late to it. After connecting and apparently being put in a WAITING LIST to join the meeting, I check my clock. I've been waiting for 26 minutes.

3- WHY IN GODS NAME IS THEIR A WAITING LIST.

4- This app is so convoluted and confusing to use, even with tutorials, that im starting to get a little bit vexed. Why is there no chatbox for this meeting? Why cant I let them know im there? WHAT IS THE POINT? Im just supposed to sit around and wait until they notice that im there? Are they not recognising me because im NOT using my college e-mail?

Those comments might be specific (e.g. ""can we change the 3rd line of paragraph 2 to say xxxx"", or they might be general (e.g. ""I am happy with the document"").

Does Teams have a way of capturing comments like this, other than going into the Word file and actually amending it to add comments?  Can comments on a file be captured within the Files tab in Teams itself somehow, and associated with the document?

2020-07-14 00:08:00,Workaround for breakout rooms for Teams,"**Background**

Just joined a social service agency that just implemented Teams in order to continue to deliver our educational content to low income, non-tech savvy beneficiaries. 

Thanks to the current situation, we had to move from a traditional classroom setting to an online format of 1 facilitator to 4-5 students

We only have about 4 Team's licenses and about 40ish beneficiaries to teach

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem**

We can't create breakout rooms because apparently our beneficiaries need to have an email (a large bulk don't even have that) and even if they did we need to integrate them into the organization, currently they join all our virtual classrooms as guests

The other solution is we can create many small meeting rooms using all the licenses we have, but since we have around 4 we are capped at 16 students

According to official documentation, Poly VVX310 and VVX311 are still compatible with Teams. They did offer a ""trade up"" program to get the new fully Teams-certified phones, but my window for that has closed. [https://www.polycom.com/content/dam/polycom/common/documents/faqs/polycom-phones-and-microsoft-teams-faq-enus.pdf](https://www.polycom.com/content/dam/polycom/common/documents/faqs/polycom-phones-and-microsoft-teams-faq-enus.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I cannot find documentation anywhere for how to get Teams to work with VVX310 or VVX311. Does anyone know?  What OS/Firmware does phone require?  What are the provisioning server addresses, encryption, etc. ?

I'm having trouble switching between organizations in Microsoft Teams desktop application. I have access to two organizations, but I can only use one organization. For example I can use Org A (Guest) but when I try to switch to Org B it gets stuck at ""We're switching you to your other account. It'll just take a moment..."". When I switch to organization B and hover over the Teams icon on the taskbar the status goes from ""Initializing"" to ""Error Occured"". Eventually, it ends up saying ""You don't have access to this org in Teams. Select another org, or contact your admin for more details."" I can switch between both organizations fine on the web app. I have other users who have the same organizations added to teams and they can switch fine between the two. What I've tried:

* Reinstalling Microsoft Office.
* Clearing Teams Cache.
* Signing in and out of Teams. 
* Removing and re-adding the user to both organizations.
* Clearing credentials.

In the log file there is an error that keeps occurring:

On IOS, either with the Outlook for IOS or the native mail/calendar/contacts, when someone inside Teams calls you, it just shows the Teams number, not the user associated with that number.  I was hoping that since the Teams numbers are populated in the AD contact fields (Teams # and mobile #) that the phone would be able to recognize that a synced contact with the matching number is calling, so show their name; this would be similar to if you had a contact directly entered into the phone with the Teams number and mobile number.    


I saw the same behavior with cell phone to cell phone for contacts synced with the global address list.. so maybe this is a --- Call-&gt;iOS Operating System(Search(Contact List -&gt; Synced Contacts)) -&gt; display caller --  issue.

Since we work a lot with other business areas (within the same organisation) we want to leverage off Private Channels within our Team where we invite the business area users to the Private Channel (currently the business area users are not part of our Team at all, we just use email for communication).

Before we can do this, we currently have 15+ Standard Channels in our Team (each for every project) which should not be seen by other business area users. Since there's no way to **convert** a standard channel to a private channel, I was hoping there may be a way to **export** the conversations from a standard channel and then later **import** them to a private channel (even if this is done by the admin).

Ideally the setup would be that our Team is still Private. We have 1-2 Standard Channels that all users are part of (our team + all other business area users). Then every project would be a Private Channel with that business area's users in it. 

If this is possible, I'll be requesting our IT Admins to perform this.

2020-07-17 20:26:37,Teams mic comes through too low,"I have seen this type of issue all over the web, but with no solution. I work for a small company and we purchased 3 Dell Latitude 3510's for new employees as they come onboard. We have in the past purchased the 3500's, but our supplier said Dell is moving away from those and offered up these 3510s. 

Our main form of meetings now a days is through the Teams app. Whenever someone talks in these new laptops the other participants in the meeting cant hear them unless they turn their volume to 100, but then everyone else sounds way too loud. We tried using plain old headphones with a mic (the ones you get when you buy an iPhone and some skull candy ones) and the sound still wasn't coming through. I have checked to make sure the Teams app has access to mic, and that the levels in the sound settings for the recording option is at 100.

Here is the strange part, the mic sounds completely normal on different apps, we tried it in a Zoom meeting and everyone could hear them fine.

   * We have looked at Zoom phone and this check box is available on a per user setting.  Check the box and calls do not ring while you are on the call.
   * Just need a simple check box under settings for a user to select.  Even the ability to follow their calendar status would be a possible option as well.

2020-07-18 05:55:37,Share files in the most accessible and easiest way for the other side,"Hi

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to figure out how to share files with students in a way that they need the fewest possible clicks to reach the files.

&amp;#x200B;

A) Sharing in OneDrive: they need to: 1) log into OneDrive, 2) click Shared, 3) select the folder, 4) click ""Add to my OneDrive"", then 5) setup the OneDrive client in their computers. It's the highest cost because I often need to do it myself in remote access.

&amp;#x200B;

B) Sharing in a chat tab: It is not feasible, because it's not made for long-term sharing. I have to manually send one by one, and I can't keep them in sync. Teams doesn't organise them A-Z by default and it doesn't even keep them in a separate folder in OneDrive (meaning all files from all chats go into the same folder.)

&amp;#x200B;

C) As for the ""Files"" tab in the sidebar, it won't show shared folders.

&amp;#x200B;

D) Sharing in the team is impossible because all members of the team can see them.

&amp;#x200B;

E) It really doesn't seem like a good use of Channels to have one for each student. Is it really the best way?

&amp;#x200B;

F) While creating the user: As a global admin, I could create the user, then log into their OneDrive, set up a folder, grant myself access, then reset their password and send it to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the ""Producer/USER-1"" starts the event, The ""Presenter/USER-2"" clicks the ""Join Live Event"" calendar item (in Office 16 client) they only ever join as an attendee.    I have tested this with my account and that is the case.  

Scenario details: 

I book the Live Event meeting using the Teams app using my Teams admin account and invite my regular Teams account as a presenter.  I start the meeting as the ""producer"" using my admin account, then, on a separate system I open the calendar invite  and click ""Join Live Event"" using the Teams app logged in as my standard teams user and I only ever see the attendee view never the ""Presenter"" view.    

On the Producer system (while the event is live and running)  I see myself listed in the ""Others Invited"" list with the only option being  ""Ask to Join"". If I click  ""Ask to Join"" it dials out to the correct account and if they accept the call and join, then they see the Presenter options.   

note: Our Tenant does NOT have Exchange for standard users so there is no calendar visible in Teams, the exception being for the admin accounts used to setup the Live Event. We user Azure Connect to sync to our AD

Basically the scenario is: 

Class Team

12 groups in class

User wants a private channel for each group

They asked if we can automate adding users they provide to the channel they designate

Is there a powershell command or something that can do this? I haven’t really had to use Teams powershell modules yet

I know I could probably create Office 365 groups with powershell and add all the users per group and just tell them to add the group to each channel


Can you even add Office 365 groups to a private channel or do you have to add per user?

We know the name that they've given the group, but so far I don't see a way to leverage that to audit the chats.  From what I see I my only option is to use keywords to track down some of the conversation and then filter by membership, but that will be a bit of a moving target as people will be/have been added and removed over time.

On a few occasions users have posted something sensitive in a private chat and asked to have it deleted. The only option I've found is to give that user the ability to delete in the admin panel, wait for it to propagate and then they delete their own message. This workflow would be OK if it wasn't for the propagation delay. 

Is there any way to allow certain admins the ability to delete other peoples messages in private chats inside of MS Teams or somewhere else in the 365 admin portal.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/hwj1uy/is_there_a_way_to_delete_other_users_message_in/,volcanonacho

2020-07-24 04:53:57,Is it possible to create a bookmarks tab that can also open specific browsers,"I'm just a regular employee at my company.  Not on the IT side.  I'm really enjoying Teams and am interested in some of the apps that comes along with it.  I'd love to learn to develop my own tools that work in Teams, but it's already looking like I'm out of my league.  

Anyway, I work for a company that hires temps on a project by project basis.  Users connect to VM's where their access is fairly restricted.  With the exception of a few whitelisted domains the internet is locked down.  Their desktops are pretty bare bones as well, so they can't create bookmarks on their web browsers.  They typically only need access to four or five links, but those links change for every project.  

My hope is to have a tab in their Team that can act as their bookmarks.  Yes, I know that I could very easily just throw links up on the team wiki or just add the doc as a new tab, but I felt that an app that creates a tab where a team owner can edit the links would come across as a bit more professional.  Am I wasting my time? 

Part two.... Let's say one link only works in Internet explorer as opposed to whatever the default browser is.  Is it possible that it can be programmed to open a specific browser for a specific link?

* We can invite external recipients to a meeting, but when they try to join (after downloading Teams), they are being asked (in some cases at least) to log in with an account.  When is it possible for a guest to jump on, without having to sign up for an account with MS?
* In a similar way, one person ran into a lack of permission to join a (test) meeting in progress.  Are their special settings to allow external recipients?
* Is it possible to setup a proper conference call, without some sort of enterprise level account or additional features?
* Finally, what is the upper limit for a meeting... how many participants?

2020-07-28 22:47:01,Teams Meeting - Why did some staff not receive the join info?,"So our receptionist likes Teams, wants to use it instead of Zoom, and so switched things up this month and planned a monthly staff meeting of about 20 folks with Teams. She made it reoccurring and sent it out to the distribution group for the related staff. 

Many of us that received it saw it as a regular calendar invite, with it had Teams info included in for joining the meeting or calling it through the Audio conferencing. We all RSVP and showed up. Everything seemed fine. 

But, there were about 4 individuals who show a meeting request from the receptionist that they responded to, but that never included the join info. These particular staff assumed a link would eventually be sent out and never contacted anyway. They missed the start of the meeting. 

I'm scratching my head, trying to figure out what factors would have prevented these folks from receiving the invite with full details, instead of just a blank calendar invite. 

Has anyone seen this before, and figure out what was causing it? Or is this a glitch? I'd sure like us to use less Zoom...

Pretty sure the answer is ""no"" or ""not yet"" according to my research, but does anyone have a solution for a favorites list of files located in different channels in Teams? Onenote a bookmark list is too labor intensive to really be a personalized option, and Delve is... a mess. I'm not going to go there but in theory it would work. You could also just bookmark the file URLs too in browser but again, kind of messy? 

You can save/bookmark conversations and posts but it looks like there's no solution for this for files. If I'm missing something or someone has a pretty straightforward workflow for a workaround I'd appreciate the information.

2020-07-29 22:24:17,"Camera stuttering/lagging but only on my side of calls, and Teams occasionally slowing to crawl and crashing my PC","Hi everyone, encountering a weird bug that I can't seem to find elsewhere online (apologies if this is common and I haven't looked hard enough).

Recently downloaded Teams for work on my desktop and it was working completely normally. On one of my first calls I played with the background effects and then turned them off, and found that my camera feed (i.e. the box in the corner that shows me) was very laggy and stuttering, not smooth at all as it had been. I apologised to colleagues on the call that I was lagging but they said my video was completely fine for them. Curiously, if I turned any background effect on my video (again, just on my side) would go back to being smooth.

Teams also sometimes slows my entire computer down when I'm on a call, invariably leading to me needing to restart my machine. It happened earlier but I was just in a meeting with one person. My audio and video was freezing and dropping in and out for them, and same for me with theirs. But I also couldn't open any other windows or apps, my desktop kept randomly appearing and mouse became unresponsive. My colleague ended the call and Teams crashed and rebooted but I was still massively slowed down. I closed Teams entirely but the slowdown wouldn't go away, so I had to restart my PC. Looking now on Task Manager the memory usage does seem quite high - I'm not on a call right now but it's sitting at around 616MB. During a slow down I don't think I would've been able to open it to check figures. This has happened a few times now.

I might be completely wrong in thinking these two issues are linked somehow but they're both very odd. The crashes happen whether I have a background effect on or not.

Since these issues started I have:

* Made sure Teams is up-to-date
* Uninstalled and reinstalled Teams multiple times (and have never been able to get my camera running smooth again as it was when I first used teams)
* Made sure my webcam drivers are up-to-date
* Uninstalled and reinstalled my webcam multiple times
* Turned Read Receipts off (I saw on old thread on here that mentioned this helps with slowdown but it was from 6 months ago)
* Played with GPU hardware acceleration
* Run Teams with no other apps open or antivirus on in the background

None of the above have had any effect whatsoever. I feel like maybe it's hardware bug and Teams doesn't like my webcam. Though the webcam works fine with other applications (e.g. Zoom) and I just tried it on my laptop with Teams and it worked! (but on test calls there doesn't seem to be a way to turn on background effects to see if I can replicate the issue).

Sorry if this is very rambling, but can help be suggested? Thank you.",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/i01khs/camera_stutteringlagging_but_only_on_my_side_of/,TheEnglishMouse

2020-07-30 01:03:17,Partial Screen Sharing with Teams?,"I did a quick search within the group to see if my question was answered - apologies if this is a duplicate. 

My organization is looking to switch from G Suite and GoToMeeting/Zoom to Microsoft 365. My question is regarding the screen sharing capabilities within Teams as compared to GoToMeeting and Zoom.

Both GoToMeeting and Zoom have a feature that allows the presenter (person sharing the screen) to only share part of the screen. I'm *not* talking about sharing only one screen in a multi-monitor setup, and I'm not talking about sharing a single application. I am talking about the ability to share just a portion of one monitor/screen.

This feature in GTM and Zoom is very important to us, as we have several users with 4K monitors, and this allows for two things:
1: the partial screen selection can be &lt;= 1080p, which means no scaling or letter-boxing on the viewer's side.
2: it allows for the presenter to have apps or files or whatever outside of the view of the participants, and can bring things in and out of view at will.

Does Microsoft Teams have this feature? I cannot find documentation of it in my Googley searches. If not, that means I have to keep GoToMeeting after the switch from G Suite.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/i048az/partial_screen_sharing_with_teams/,TimmyzBeach

2020-08-03 05:57:58,New Company + MS Teams + Yealink T56A = Horrible,"I need help with MS Teams, Microsoft Business Voice, and desktop phones, specifically the Yealink T5X series. Here is the reader's Digest:  

1. Built a new company from scratch. Got Microsoft 365 + Business Voice. 
2. Our physical office network is 9 users on a Verizon FIOS 1 gig up and 1 gig down connection. We legit have 2ms ping times and test out at 960 mbps in both directions. the perfect internet connection. 
3. Purchased a dozen Yealink T56 phones for MS Teams and Business Voice.  All are hardwired, and connected with brand new ethernet cables to a brand new switch. All links are 1 gig and phones are powered by PoE.

My point:  Hardware, speed, network, and all that isn't the problem.  

The real problem is the performance of the desktop phones just SUCK.  Pardon my French. 

When I go to pickup the handset, I have to wait for a dial tone. Sometimes I don't get one and have to hang up and pick back up again.  Then I go to dial a number on the keypad, and the phone misses half the digits I am pressing.  

I dial 555-123-1234 and the phone display shows ""551323"" missing half the damned numbers. It's like the phone is on an 8088 IBM XT and we're waiting for the damned floppy disk. WTF? 

If I get through to anyone or anything, and God forbid there is an IVR that says ""enter your debit card number"", I break out into a cold sweat because I know it will be next to impossible to press 16 digits on this phone on this system and have it actually work correctly.  

I'm ready to toss the entire thing in the garbage and call a real phone company. I paid a lot of good money for this whole setup and last time I checked, we lived in 2020 -- the future. I expected to get a pretty decent working desk phone system. 

My apologies if this comes off sarcastic, or wise, or whatever.  But I am just frustrated as all hell that this whole thing is complete and utter crap.  I've updated firmware until kingdom come, made sure all the hardware was good and it wasn't something we were doing, reset/reloaded/redid almost everything in creation to try to make it work.  

Thanks for listening to me bitch. I'm a tech guy through and through, so I know how to troubleshoot and know the right questions to ask.  I only need the answer to one question: 

**""What the hell is the problem here?""**

1. Yealink T56/58 hardware being under-powered. 
2. MS Teams software on the Yealink phone. It's Android based, right? 
3. MS Teams server-side processing is a disaster. 
4. Microsoft 365 Business Voice is a complete afterthought and it's a combination of all of the above. 

Pick one of the above. Because I am about to lose it, and I know one thing is certain:  It's not our fault because we bought the best hardware, went with the ""best"" solution, have the best connectivity, and this should work real simple.  

Alright. That felt damned good to type out after a long week trying to solve a billion tech problems.  On that note, anyone have some suggestions on a real phone system for a new crypto/tech startup? :)",1.0,1.0,1.0,22.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/i2kn83/new_company_ms_teams_yealink_t56a_horrible/,CoinMover

I work for a software consulting company.  Our organization deals with several different products.  Each product has it's own staff/Organizational Unit and its own customers that it works with on an ongoing basis.  Our big projects are typically Go-Lives and Upgrades for new or existing customers.  Big projects typically involve a subset of users from the organizational unit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just trying to figure out how best to organize things at the start.  Should we:

* Create a team for each of the org-units, with a channel for each customer and project?
* Create a team for each of the org-units, with channels for individual customers for ongoing support issues.  And then create a separate team for each of the big projects?
* Create new teams for basically everything?
* Something else I'm not yet thinking of.

After the meeting invite is sent, I go into that meeting on the Teams calendar, click on Meeting Options, and select People in my organization as the only ones who can bypass the lobby and who can present. 

This may be a really obvious question but I was asked to find this out. Does Teams use our email domain to determine who the people in my organization are, or because I'm sending out the meeting invite from Outlook with all of our board members listed on the Required line they are all considered part of the organization?

Specs:

- Windows 10 Pro (1909 / 18363.959)
- Teams Desktop App (latest version)
- Nvidia GTX 970 (if that matters at all)

Other things I know/have done:

- Firewall on/off makes no difference
- Appears to be no increased network traffic when cam is on, though I did this while in a solo call so might not attempt transmission until someone joins
- No IP addresses blocked in hosts file
- No unusual/custom firewall rules present which could block
- Network isn't the issue - tethering teams off my phone (which uses data rather than wifi) still doesn't show any video. Used Teams on my phone and had no issues.
- Ran one of Microsoft's tools for checking ports related to Teams/Skype for Business, didn't mention any errors/block when completed
- I've got multiple virtual machines (one through VirtualBox, other through WSL) and servers of sorts (Node JS) running which might take/block ports

2020-08-07 09:34:33,MS Teams (Crestron UC-160) Conference Room and One Touch Join - Security/Identity Question,"Team,

So... quick one for you all... we are deploying Crestron UC-160 Flex system in our conference rooms.  One of the benefits of the MS Teams room experience is one touch join... One of our executives brought up a good question which is... what happens if someone who isn't a part of a meeting were to walk into a conference room and just press join?  Could they join a meeting that is discussing confidential/privileged info?

I could see this happening when a meeting perhaps is scheduled for a conference room, but the team simply takes the meeting from their desk and does NOT update meeting location... So then random employee X walks into the conference room and hits JOIN...

I know there are MS Teams policies about lobbies/host pin to start meeting etc... but how would we incorporate a policy/security to prevent this but also not make it overly complex (goal is one touch join)...

I know this is not a normal occurrence, but I was asked the ? and it made me wonder... I suspect that most of the time, if a room shows busy during a time, employees would not be wandering into the room... also, if they did happen to wander in... becuaae the room is a MS Teams room, they would hit join and immediately they would show up on webcam... so those on the call would simply stop talking and say hey... get out of there?  Something to that effect...

Anyhow... curious for your thoughts/feedback.

2020-08-09 20:33:02,Finalstraw,"Dear Microsoft.
This is the second time I have written you off as a shambling entity disinterested in pursuing client relations. You probably have just written me off already but let's face it. This message was always going to fall on deaf ears so clearly it is being written for my own benefit.
For almost twenty years, my brother and myself have been waiting the much anticipated sequel to the famed pso2 franchise. To our utter and complete dismay, we were left with the prospect of it being only potentially released in the U.S. By yourselves. And as suspected, your belligerence has crushed those decades of longing and love of a cherished game that had special meaning for us.
I took a long shot chance and downloaded the game on my PC when I noticed it on the app store. At first I ignored it thinking what has been verified for me now; ""Microsoft will destroy my experience anyway."" And so you have.
To my utter shock the game worked. I even connected my ps4 controller to the PC and began to relive memories an once. Then my brother tried and guess what... The app won't start. THEN guess what... At the function to allow the app to make changes I.e. run the application, I closed the window because I forgot I was currently working on something else. ""No big deal,"" I thought. ""I'll play again in a moment."" But I'll never be able to again because my pso2 app DOESN'T RUN AT ALL anymore. And I don't want to try all your silly restart procedures because the bottom line with any entity which relies on that tired remedy has fundamentally wronged the process by which decent business and client relations form. I have seen this many times with phones, consoles and finally computers. As a result I've let go of your phones, your consoles and now likely your disgusting computers. I am horrified at the notion of indulging in some products for the foreseeable future but the alternative would be defending and promoting your failed model of a brand to people who consistently and blatantly mock me for utilizing your disreputable services. All of them. One by one I've migrated to a more reliable and customer friendly source despite resisting such a thing for as long as I possibly could. If I never have to deal with your erroneous products and services ever again it will be far too soon.
I have made it to my last possible ounce of patience with the damned Microsoft brand, service, products and even people. Xbox live is a trash heap of degenerate scum lining the sewers. No where else have I experienced such despicable people. Yet I understand why they are this way- you foster and allow it to fester with your operational policies in every corner of your company.
You've ruined everything I could enjoy and rely on for everyday life. The worst part is that I always defended you because you were an American company which I always opt to support. Your cash-grabbing ineptitude has finally spread too far and worn me too weak to respect anything you stand for, products or otherwise.
You disgust me.

2) I'm not sure how to see who is on a call or not. On our current system we have BLF lights so we can see when someone's line is busy. This means we can say they aren't available, without having to call them. It also lets us know when someone is away from desk as someone can hit the away button and we know how many people are answering the phones. I realise we can see status of other people in Teams but is there an easy way to see an overview for your own org? Can you tell when someone is on a call?

I am considering selling Teams also and I know I will get asked these questions so any help would be greatly appreciated.

I am very new to using teams and I hope someone here can help me out. 

I am trying to create a links page in a channel for my team. A number of different places online suggested using an app from SharePoint. I like the way it looks and the way it works. However, I don't like that I can add links from Teams. I want to only be able to add links in SharePoint only and have teams be read-only. I am the team owner, and I know that I can make the app read-only for the other team members. I want this particular app to function the same for me and my team members.   


I'm also open to additional ideas about the links page. If there is a better way, I am open to hearing it.

It seems that whenever I do not have ""*Disable GPU hardware acceleration (requires restarting Teams)*"" ticked in Teams settings, my system becomes much slower and will eventually lock up. The only way that I have been able to fix this is by holding the power button to force my machine to shut down.

2020-08-13 02:41:32,Reoccurring Meetings of Individual Meetings in a Court Setting???," I'm struggling with a theoretical question that I am hoping you all can help with. Use case is a courtroom scenario: 

In SfB we ended up preferring long term reoccurring meetings (with lobby) to emulate the concept of an existing physical infrastructure of a vacant courtroom that's always available and folks can be scheduled into it. It also solved the 1000 meeting max in SfB. There was no persistent chat so everything worked relatively well with this model (aside from other problems with SfB). Send users a link for each courtroom with a date and time to appear and you are good to go.

With Teams though, the persistent chat feature is problematic in that users who were in the meeting would presumably have access to chat and files long after their case is done. As such, we were thinking that we would be scheduling individual meetings for everything. Unfortunately, this is somewhat more cumbersome for scheduling. I guess my question is whether this is a completely accurate understanding of the existing scenario and see if you have any additional insight as to possible workarounds.

TLDR: Reoccuring meetings in SfB, worked well. I would still prefer the reoccurring meeting personally in Teams but the persistent chat/file thing is problematic.

2020-08-14 23:53:32,Interesting Issues with Microsoft Teams on MacBook Pro,"I am running into a whole host of different issues with Microsoft Teams on my MacBook Pro. 

If someone tries to initiate a video call with me, I answer, and the call drops about 5-10 seconds later (prompted with a ""Retry call message"". What is weird is that they can hear/see me but I cannot hear/see them. If I call them back I do not have these issues... but if they try and share their screen with me it fails. 

I have tried connected to my corporate VPN (split tunneling is enabled), disconnected from VPN, from multiple networks, and still seem to be having the same problems. What is very odd is that if it is a planned meeting I can join and have no issues whatsoever. 

Others in my organization have been seeing the same issues.. with the exception of one user who received a brand new machine that did not have Office 2019 installed on it previously. (We recently upgrade to 365).

Has anyone experienced these issues and resolved them?

Specs of MacBook Pro:

13inch 2017 Model

Processor: 3.1 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5

Memory: 8GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3.

Graphics: Intel Iris Plus Graphics 510 1536 MB

OS: macOS Catalina (10.15.6)

Troubleshooting steps taken:

1. Completely removed Office 365 Suite using Microsoft article as guidance for what to remove.

2. Tried using another user account (Machine is domain joined). 
3. Verified that the ports are open on our corporate firewall. 
4. Opened Microsoft ticket with no answer. (Been open for 2 months)
5. Verified that the browser based version functions with no issues. 
6. Verified that the app has the correct security permissions for mic, camera, screen sharing, etc.
7. Reset netowrking preferences by removing the following .plist files

* **com.apple.airport.preferences.plist**
* **com.apple.network.eapolclient.configuration.plist**
* **com.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist**

So before summer, my son had to use Teams (the app) to video chat with class and teacher (using iPad, latest one). He would join video chat, however, his video never showed. It would just show his picture, while we could see every other child and teachers video.
I checked settings —&gt;privacy—&gt;camera—&gt;teams 
And it was enabled.
I checked settings —&gt;[scrolled down to Teams] and camera access is enabled. Everything is good to go but no video of my son is popping up.
iPad is up to date and latest versions.

This school year is starting and his school issued a brand new iPad to each student so I thought, okay this time it will work because it’s a different device, but nope. Same issue. He had his first meeting today and everyone was able to see each other, but him. He can talk, but no one can see him. I checked everything, and it’s all enabled, nothing is blocked. He is able to talk and mute, just no video. 
It’s beginning to become very frustrating. 

Does anyone know what may be the issue? 
Whenever it’s a class setting and MORE than 1 person, the video doesn’t work and when i click on the “3 dots” at the bottom, the start video option is not there.

2. Is there a way when we create homework, projects, evaluations or activities, to tell MST if a student gets 100 points in his project, it has to convert that 100 points into the percentage assigned to this aspect? So, instead of saying that the student got 100 points, he got 40%?

2020-08-17 10:08:04,Using Teams to Convene External Guests,"My 30-person nonprofit (now with Office 365) is in the process of switching over to Teams for internal communications. It's an exciting development.  I'm wondering whether we can stretch our use of Teams even further. Allow me to explain:

The nonprofit runs a variety of programs, most of which iterate annually; in a typical year, several hundred people participate in one of our programs. We are looking for a platform (separate from -- but connected to -- the space used exclusively by our internal staff ) that will allow the program alumni to congregate (a) by affiliation (e.g., participants from a particular program iteration, or all alumni from a program regardless of the iteration they joined) and (b) by interest (e.g., topics that cross-cut multiple/all programs). As such, we'd encourage everyone to engage in more than one channel. 

(If we were a university instead of a nonprofit, we'd be looking for a platform that allows the Class of 2020 to congregate separately and privately from the Classes of 2019 and 2018, but for anyone from any of these classes with an interest in current events to join the current events discussion; in film to join the film discussions; and for alumni to create new interest channels of their own.)

We'd like to give every program alum access to the space, but recognize that many of them will not participate with any consistency. As a nonprofit, paying a flat fee per user per year may be cost prohibitive.

So before the summer holiday I deleted al the old Teams.

We (i think i need to keep this part kind of vague) are comparing two chat systems for use in the future. One is [Rocket.Chat](https://Rocket.Chat), one is Microsoft Teams. Users have Android Phones.   


Discovered with [Rocket.Chat](https://Rocket.Chat) that push notifications seem to have to use the Google push notification system. As in, if downloaded from the App Play Store, have to use \*their\* gateway servers. I can do my own, but i'd have to use Android's/Google firebase system, and get keys through google. 

What I can't seem to find, is the same kind of info about Teams. As in, is it going through google at any point? Is Microsoft using their own push gateway servers? Are push packets encrypted, or if not, what do they contain?   


I honestly, really do prefer teams, but Privacy is fairly important to this organization. I need to at least be able to point in the right direction, and i don't understand Push tech at enough of a low level to be able to say i know anything. I know it's ""Cloud based"" meaning i don't have to push notifications from my own server out, but do they?   


Do you guys have any insight? Already scanned through the Teams docs on Microsoft's site. Anywhere to look specific? I have googled for a couple days, and usually my google-fu is strong, but i think i might be mis-understanding something at a basic level since i'm not finding applicable data.

You can see the 'Audio Streams Monthly Trend' on the main [Microsoft Teams Call Quality Dashboard](https://cqd.teams.microsoft.com/).

  
We have adopted more and more of Teams over the past few months, with many people working from home.  We use an enterprise proxy with a client on each computer.  In March, our percent of poor audio streams was 14%.  We've found that we needed to allow UDP access to Teams servers, rather than push through the proxy, and our numbers have improved.  We currently are seeing closer to 4% poor audio streams.

2020-08-18 04:23:44,Quiet audio when dialing into a meeting with Teams,"Hi,

We are currently evaluating switching from Zoom to Teams, although I have one problem that keeps coming up, from many meetings over the last 3 months.  

Parties that dial into a meeting are significantly quieter than those that do not. I have heard this on about 10 calls and tested it on about 3 calls to confirm. If I use the Teams app to join a call, the audio is great, although when dialing in (as well as clients dialing in), they are just hard to hear. If you turn your volume all the way up, you can make out what they're saying, but if someone else that connects via their computer or app talks, they're super loud.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a known problem? Anyway to fix it? We do not experience the same issue with Zoom.  

I have tried changing to preferred dial in number, although that didn't seem to help.

TLDR:  Is there a way to drag/drop or place participants in the channels you want them to be in?

So I work at a school in the Autism cluster... today was the first day of E-Learning and it's been a disaster.  Hoping that the answer to this question may help the teachers out a bit (I am basically a teacher's assistant, but I'm reasonably good with tech stuff so I've become the go-to guy for things like this).

Anyway, the problem is our students are anywhere from 4-9 years old, and being in the ""special autism program"", some have more capabilities that others.  All the teacher's channels have been setup, and they (for example) have a ""general"" channel to talk to all the students, but then want to have a ""reading group"" to work with 1-2 students, while another 2-3 students work with the teacher's assistant  in ""math group"" and another 2-3 are working with another assistant in ""independent work"".  They may be in these groups for 20-30 minutes and then are supposed to switch to another group/activity.  

The problem is that it is very difficult at their age and ability to shrink windows down, go to other channels, click Join, click Join again, etc etc.  Is there a way to ""drag and drop"" participants to the different channels?

Any suggestions would be great.  Thank you very much.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/ics8kb/forcing_someone_into_a_particular_team_channel/,phunknsoul

&amp;#x200B;

Just a quick question.

&amp;#x200B;

Im a live staff trainer within the company i work for and we are moving to Microsoft teams soon for our live chat solution.

&amp;#x200B;

In my role i listen to live phone-calls that our support/sales staff are having with customers, while live i provide them with prompts/support and training via chat, for them to then relay to the customer in real time.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem however is that given the time to type the prompt and send, the moment for it to be raised or the window for a sales prompt may be short and possibly pass, the text also can cause broken conversation on the support staff side due to them pausing to read.

&amp;#x200B;

Im looking to implement images to send, where they will be color coded and have simple words for quick recall where common prompts are required.

For this to be efficient i was hoping that someone may know of a teams add-on where all images could potentially be on 'soundboard' type table where they are just clicked and sent.

Similar to the emoji tray, where its a pop up menu, click and send.

2020-08-22 00:06:00,Possible hacked account or malicious script / bot?,"Hi,

We have a user who's Teams is sending seemingly random insulting messages out to other staff members as per the screenshot below. 

This started about a month ago and at the time, we could not find the vector that they were using to send these messages so we ended up just wiping the machine. The issue went away for a few weeks but has now returned. 

I appreciate that this isn't a Cyber Security forum but given that I do not use Teams very much myself, I only really support it technically, I was interested to see if anyone knows of any way any kind of script or schedule could be created to send out such messages?

We're not currently sure if its the account hacked or the machine but the user thinks he saw one message try and go out when he wasn't connected to the internet possibly suggesting a script of some kind. I have checked Microsoft Flow on the account and that is empty.

The messages are commonly exactly what you see below. Not exactly hardcore insults but embarrassing all the same. 

Teams is only being used on one machine. No mobile devices have it. The account is protected by MFA but when we had this last time, changing the password did not seem to help suggesting it wasn't a hacked Office 365 account.

Is there any way to show what bots or addins a user has? I viewed my app settings but it doesn't seem very clear as to exactly what is installed.

Given that the machine was wiped, if its something to do with an app or bot, it would likely have to be added to the account in some way to survive the machine being wiped, unless of course he has managed to re-infect himself with whatever he had before in \*exactly\* the same way.

Obviously the PC has been scanned. Its also a reasonably high security site - decent Watchguard firewall with Watchguard TDR infection control and no local admin permitted. 

Anyone have any thoughts?

Thanks!

2020-08-24 19:48:31,Create a mock participant for screen sharing?,"TLDR:  I want a ""feed/stream/view of a website/window"" to appear as a participant in Teams.  Or a similar workaround.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi,

Is there a way, either already in Teams or through external programs for a presenter to create a ""mock participant"" that would really just be a screen/windows share?  So in other words, other participants would see the ""Brady Bunch"" grid of all participants, but one ""participant"" would actually be a screen share (or really just a view of a website) from one of the presenters?  

Basically the reason I'd like to do this is I work at an elementary school and we are doing e-learning for obvious reasons.  I work with students with autism and having a behavior chart always in view is very important.  I'd like to be able to have the students always see a behavior chart, ideally that could be manipulated by the teacher as well as the teacher assistants... there are websites that will allow this, but I need that window to be seen by the students on the normal Teams chat view rather than having the teacher share their screen which changes everyone's view (including the teacher's).  

Sorry for the long post but just want to ensure I'm explaining well.  So the view from a participant's point of view would (for example) be a 3x3 grid with the teacher in the top left corner and a website ""participant"" in the bottom right... they could pin the teacher and the website ""participant"" if they wanted to.

TLDR:  I want a ""feed/stream/view of a website/window"" to appear as a participant in Teams.  Or a similar workaround.

2020-08-25 01:52:59,Desktop Imaging with MS Teams,"There are a couple of issues in our corporate image related to MS Teams that have bugged me for a while and I'm hoping someone has a clever solution for them.

First issue is the creation of a desktop icon 'Microsoft Teams.lnk' created in the user's Desktop folder 30-60 seconds after their first logon. I've tried getting around this with a trick I've used in the past by placing this icon into the 'Users\\Default\\Desktop' folder with System and Hidden attributes enabled. This hidden icon does get copied into the user's profile on their first login, but Teams overwrites it with a visible one shortly after that. Is there any policy anywhere that prevents this icon? At present it's the only one on a new user's desktop.

The second issue is an extension of the first. Since the Teams shortcut is stored in the 'users' start menu folder, and there is a delay creating it on first login, my start menu and taskbar layout XML can't pin the items at first login and are thus ignored. I tried solving this issue by putting a 'Microsoft Teams.lnk' file in the all users' profile, but then realized it must point to an exe in the user's profile. What a mess. I'm not hopeful there is a solution this one but I would really like to have Teams pinned to the users Taskbar with the rest of the Office suite.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/iftzls/desktop_imaging_with_ms_teams/,Xaxoxth

I love Microsoft Teams. I use it, and the rest of the O365 suite for work. I thought it would be a good idea to move my family to it - since this is now a 'thing'. We use shared lists in Microsoft To-do, shared Microsoft calendar, OneDrive, etc.

I've only taken the preliminary steps, which was simply adding my wife so we can chat. Works great, considering I'm able to use multiple organizations in iOS.

Then I tried to talk to her from the desktop app...

I can't believe that the desktop app doesn't support multiple organizations! Slack has been doing this for years.

I thought this would be easy to overcome. Just log into teams in my personal Edge profile. I tried that and Teams told me I don't belong to any organizations!",1.0,1.0,1.0,61.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/ifwy08/i_moved_my_family_chat_to_microsoft_teams_whoops/,segaboy81

2020-08-25 11:21:23,Crestron Flex Kits and Display Control (Auto On/Off),"We're starting to roll out MS Teams Rooms which from a design and hardware perspective have been orders of magnitude easier than some of our previously over engineered endeavors.  For the majority of our builds we're using the Crestron UC-C160-T for UC Engine and Touch Panel with varying degrees of hardware for audio/video depending on the room size.  

All is well (as well of MS Teams can be) until we've quickly realized that our displays are no longer being powered on/off automatically.  We either need to leave the display on with a bouncing screensaver logo so when someone approaches the touch panel the display is ready OR tell folks to press power on the TV remote which while not the end of the world is certainly a step backwards for us.  

I understand why this is happening, namely we stripped out all of our Crestron controller hardware (so no RS232 fun) and the Flex also doesn't support CEC for consumer grade displays.  

I did a little digging and found this note on the MS website

 **If you desire a front of room display to automatically switch to an active video source (such as an MTR console) when the source wakes from standby mode, certain conditions must be met. This feature is optional but supported by Microsoft Teams Rooms software, provided underlying hardware supports the feature. A consumer TV used as a front of room display needs to support the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) feature of HDMI. Depending on the dock or console selected (which might not support CEC, refer to manufacturer support documentation), a controller such as an** [**HD-RX-201-C-E**](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/HDMI-Solutions/HDMI-Extenders/HD-RX-201-C-E) **from Crestron or** [**Extron HD CTL 100**](https://www.extron.com/article/hdctl100ad) **from Extron may be needed to enable the desired behavior.**   

Anyone have any suggestions on how to best tackle this going forward in our design?  Do we need to stick with commercial displays using RS232 or is there a more cost effective solution?",1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/ig4atz/crestron_flex_kits_and_display_control_auto_onoff/,Orwellian84

The text box is no longer selected, and you can’t even tab to it. You have to manually click on the window again to select it. Why?

- Video chat (1 on 1 and groups)

We have some issues with some Teams Room Systems.

We run a Skype for Business hybrid environment - and are in the process of moving users to Teams in batches.

We have a Skype meeting room (on-prem)

We use the command Move-csmeetingroom, so the identity is moved to O365. Then we change the meeting room to Teams only. 

Then we sign in trough a Teams Room System. When we do, it looks like its signing in - and I can create a meeting, participate in scheduled Meetings, and dial-out.

But, the device is still displaying ""signing-in"" in the top of the screen. We have a mix of Lenevo Hubs and HP slice. But it does not seem to be device-specific. 

I can sign from a Teams Client, and a Skype Client (of course shows ""we are now using Teams"" dialog).

My question: What is it, it still trying to sign in - it's not Teams or Exchange (I can see from Azure Audit Log)

And maybe better - where can I find relevant log files on the device, where I can see what it tries to sign-in to?

Sometimes it works for a while when you delete the app and wait for a reinstall, sometimes if you delete it and install it manually, but the problem always returns after a while

The problem always starts with the bar in the bottom flickering, it's super laggy and it's sometimes not even possible to close the app. 

It is as if it just overpowers the phone and uses 100% of the resources. I have included a video clip in the post that shows how it looks like when it does this, take note of the flickering bar at the bottom.

Many colleagues do not even dare to open Teams on the phone since everything on the phone starts to act strange until they manage to close the app.

2020-08-27 03:13:21,Help w/Surface Hub 2s &amp; Teams Meetings,"Hi Reddit,

I am having an issue with a Microsoft Surface Hub 2s where the Teams app will not function properly - it only displays a grey screen. 

When I invite the room to a Teams meeting it does show up on the home screen,[ but if you try to Join the meeting or open the Teams app from the list of apps, it just displays a gray background on the right third of the Surface Hub's screen.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/164851i48680295BB4D234C?v=1.0) 

The Hub's Device Account has been sync'd with Azure AD and it has a Teams Room license assigned to it. 

I have fully reset the Surface Hub with no luck. It is up to date with the latest updates it found when searching from Windows Update in settings. 
 
I have added the Surface Hub to InTune and set it to Mode 1 via device configuration policy - this makes Teams show up in the app list, but does not cure the gray screen issue. 

I have tried two different network connections, in case the firewall on one of them was an issue - this doesn't seem to be the case, I get the same behavior regardless of which connection I use. 

I've also found that if I open Edge on the Surface Hub and get to the Teams web UI, I can sign in and join meetings via the web version of Teams without a problem. 

One suggested resolution I found for this issue when searching was to set DeleteComments to False on the device account for the hub, but that was already set correctly in my case. 

Google results are somewhat light for this issue and I'm pretty stuck, so I'm hoping that someone here has a bit more experience and may be able to shed some light on this.

2020-08-27 11:48:24,How to go back to a previous menu from a nested auto attendant menu,"The documentation for a Teams auto attendant says the user can either say 'back' or press # to go back to  previous menu. In the very next sentence, it says the 'back' feature is only available in the directory. To further confuse the issue, the small business example uses # to go back to previous menus, but it doesn't work if you actually implement the example solution. In short, pressing # in a nested auto attendant is the same as pressing \*, which is repeat. Apparently, you can never get back to the previous menu. Does anyone have a solution to this?

&gt; The keys \* (Repeat) and # (Back) are reserved by the system and can't be reassigned. If speech recognition is enabled, pressing \* will correspond with ""Repeat"" and # will correspond with the ""Back"" voice commands. The # (Back) option is only available within the Directory Search feature. Pressing # (Back) outside of Directory Search will repeat the current auto attendant.

I'm trying to understand the data relationship between Sharepoint and Teams. I find that I can access the same information from both applications and I feel like I understand it but I can't explain it to other users--so maybe I don't get it.

So, when you set up a Sharepoint or Teams site, is the data that both applications access essentially OneDrive? I ask because when I see the data, it always points to Sharepoint.

Can someone point me to a source that explains how these applications share data? Microsoft's documentation didn't make sense.

Activity and ""Chat"" -&gt; ""Recent"" get completely overwhelming after a day or so, with so many messages, calls and meetings all mixed up.

It's also not easy to switch to other colleagues DMs or other channels by keyboard, with either search or /goto. Goto does not include DMs for some reason, and search is arbitrarily sorted, shows lots of unwanted things and focuses on ""Show all"" instead of ""Best match"".

This makes keyboard navigation very slow, and mouse navigation as well since the views are scattered around with many subviews to go through.

So I have been tasked with building management a PowerBI report which gives an overview of all staff member's Team stats. Things like Inbound/Outbound call volume. How long a user spent on the phone, etc.  


Another interesting requirement is management want to monitor a toll free number in the business. It's one of those Auto attendant numbers where it's 1 for Sales. 2 for Service. 3 for Contracts, etc.  
They want to know how many times a caller picked option 1, or 2, and so forth.  


We're using Azure at my company and we have access to Azure SQL.  


From my understanding first of all we need the back-end infrastructure in place. We need to pull the Teams data into an SQL Database. I think this is with something called OData.  


Then the Dashboard can be developed in PowerBI which connects to the SQL database and uses it as a data source. I think I'll be more or less OK with the PowerBI stuff. By no means an expert but I built HR a Dashboard based on a big SharePoint list so I know my way around PowerBI at least enough to get me started.  


The whole project seems a bit overwhelming though and I've told the head of IT that I really am not comfortable in giving management timescales as to when it can be done because first I need to get my head around how the back-end part works, then the PowerBI part is going to take some time, and then on top of that I also need to deal with incoming tickets into the Help desk and it does seem like a pretty large project for someone with very little experience.

I work in education and my colleagues and I have been using Teams on the iPad to provide assignments for students for some time now.

Normally we ask students to complete their work on paper and then upload an image of it to the iPad app. When viewing their work on the app, we would select the image and then share it to the notes app (or other note taking app) in order to mark it with the pencil.

The ability to do this appears to be no longer available. As selecting the image will not bring a high-res version any longer and there is no option to share/download the image. Therefore we cannot mark the students work, only provide feedback in the feedback box. 

This change appears to have been implemented only recently. Is anyone else having this issue? If so, are there any work arounds? Or why have Microsoft taken this away?

Looking for some help or workarounds to sort my folders in teams. I have a folder for each day of the month (September 1,2020, September 2,2020) and so on.

2020-09-03 00:08:36,"Issue with auto attendants, call queues, and voicemail","I have an auto attendant configured with an operator and several menu options routing voicemails to appropriate groups. The auto attendant resource account is licensed for Phone System - Virtual User. The menu options forward to other auto attendants which themselves forward to O365 group voicemail boxes. This is all working well and users are happy.

My issue is with the operator and voicemail. The desire is to have a menu option on the auto attendant that routes to a person. If that person is unavailable (busy or doesn't answer after some time) the call should route to other users and ultimately a group voicemail box. That voicemail box would preferably be one of the O365 group boxes mentioned earlier.

I have tried to configure this with several different methods.

**Call queue**. I created a call queue and added call agents with serial routing. The resource account for this call queue is unlicensed, maybe that's the issue? I just added a Phone System - Virtual User license to it and I'll test again. Call overflow and time out are configured for the O365 group voicemail box. 

*   Calls routed to this call queue from the auto attendant get the hold music for a moment then the typical call queue delay, then the front desk phone rings, then half the time the call is connected and half the time the call drops. Callers report they hear a ""click"" and the call is disconnected.
*   Experimenting with *Conference mode* I found the calls to answer much faster and did not observe any failures but the front desk phone was unable to transfer calls to other users. This is a Crestron UC-P100-T.

**Direct to operator**. Forgoing the call queue option I can send calls directly to the front desk as an operator or a *person in org* redirect from the auto attendant. 

*   All calls come through to the front desk phone with no failures. Voicemail obviously goes directly to the front desk user's box (licensed for Common Area Phone with Calling Plan). These voicemails are now separate from the other main O365 group box and don't have the same voice script. I can't seem to reroute the front desk's voicemail to anything other than another user in the org. If I could route it to a call queue or voice app I might be able to work around this problem.

I'm not sure of the best path to meet all of the requirements. Has anyone else experienced the call dropping with call queues configured this way?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/il9omg/issue_with_auto_attendants_call_queues_and/,Selcouthit

2020-09-03 08:12:42,"Elementary Music Teacher - 3rd Week using Teams, issues","I am using the Teams app on a mid-2009 MacBook Pro running El Capitan.

I teach 4 classes per day, 4 days a week. Three of the classes are Live Events because the number of students is around 200 each. The rest of the classes are Meetings and will have between 30-60 students. In total, there are almost 900 students at my school. I have no experience in Teams before March, when the pandemic sent us virtual. I am having so many struggles with this platform. 

The whole school uses Teams, and so each homeroom teacher has their Team, and each Connections (Music, Art, PE, Technology, STEM, Writing Lab) teacher has their Team. In my one team, I've created separate channels for each class. I shared my Team CODE and link with the school. I also manually typed in all 900 names to add the students as Members, because I wanted to make things as easy as possible for students. On top of that, i set up the classes as recurring meetings scheduled in each channel, AND added the respective students as attendees. Despite all of this, I constantly get requests to join the team. Of course students are doing this DURING the class time when I am trying to teach. I'll see a notification of a slew of requests, but then when I go to approve them, there are no ""Pending Requests"" in ""Manage Team."" Eventually they appear, but it's stressful when there are anxious students and parents waiting. Nevermind that I spent hours typing in the names so they should not have had to make a request.

Then there was the issue of students starting their own meetings after the class had finished. The first time this happened, I was panicking because I could not figure out how to end the meeting. I know that you have to click the three dots and select ""end meeting"" but that option was not showing up for me, presumably because I wasn't the one who started that meeting. In a panic, I went into all the settings I could find restricting every possible permission I could... and I seem to have been able to maintain control by doing TWO things - 1. Scheduling all classes as recurring meetings and configuring the ""Meeting Options"" to ""Only Me"" for who can bypass the lobby and who can present. It sucks that the Meeting Options option does not appear until you have established the recurring calendar event, so you have to ""send"" it out and then click back into it, and the default is NOT how I want it... but at least in a recurring meeting I don't have to set the meeting options for EVERY SINGLE class. And 2. Making sure ""Channel Moderation"" is ON in all channels, allowing ONLY Moderators to start new posts. 

Other benefits to scheduling the classes like this with the calendar are: 1. the meeting has a title which makes it that much easier to feel confident you're in the right place, or know whether you're in the wrong meeting; 2. I can share a direct link to the actual meeting by copying and pasting it from the details section in the calendar event, instead of just sharing the Team or Channel link where people still have to figure out which ""Join"" or ""Meet"" button to click, and it's easy for someone to start a separate meeting and just sit in there and wait, not knowing that the class is actually in a different meeting.

This might work fine except that teachers are really pissed at me because they're getting notification emails about every meeting. Teachers who have NOT been invited are getting invitations. Teachers who have not been named as attendees are somehow appearing as ""optional attendees"" unbeknownst to me. The only solution to this, it seems, is removing them from the Team. The only reason teachers need to be on my team is to check and make sure their students went to the right specials class.. and to help instruct students how to get there.

So I removed teachers who were complaining, and I also made a screen video of how to route all messages from my team to some other folder (making a rule in Outlook)... 

And then there are the meetings themselves. Once the attendees get up above 25 or so, my computer becomes so very frustratingly slow. The controls will not even appear. A click does nothing. Meanwhile students can unmute themselves because I can only ""mute all"".... nobody can keep them muted. So I'll be sitting there scrolling trying to find the person who unmuted but the attendee list won't come up... forget screen sharing. I tried the whiteboard and thought my settings wouldn't allow attendees to write on it, but they were writing all over it, and I was stuck - I couldn't get out of it. I had to restart Teams. And then every meeting there are people who say they can't see me. Why can't they see me? If I'm the presenter, shouldn't my video always be visible? So I teach them how to pin me, but it doesn't work for everybody.

So, I just needed to get that out. Would love to see any comments you might have.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/ilivne/elementary_music_teacher_3rd_week_using_teams/,Reebelcha

At first, I thought that the video was just too quiet and thought nothing of it but a bit later one of the lessons got boring and I decided to watch youtube during it. That was the second time I noticed this problem. I even asked my classmates if they had this problem and if it even is one or if it was supposed to be this way. Everyone could hear youtube, Netflix, and every other app. So I decided to try and fix this problem, but there weren't any options to allow background sounds or anything similar. Then I even tried muting the meeting however it didn't work, so it seems that the program itself basically turns sounds from other applications off.

2020-09-03 19:58:28,Issue when trying to schedule a meeting within a channel,"Kind of a weird issue. We can create and schedule meetings just fine, except for when we try to schedule a meeting within a team/channel. We select the schedule meeting button on the right side of the window, go through the steps, and once we hit send it completes, but if you go to the calendar, the new meeting is greyed out and a wheel is spinning. It never completes. When doing the same process in the web app, hitting send doesn't accomplish anything.

We are running an Exchange hybrid setup. On prem Exchange servers connecting to Office365 for Teams and a few other apps. I work at a highly regulated area, so security policies are blocking a number of areas, so I'm wondering if that is causing the issue. However, it's odd that this is the only area where we are experiencing issues when scheduling meetings.

For the life of me I cannot find a document or video anywhere describing how to add this device to my Teams Tenant. 

Anyone have any experience with this?

User A chats with User B in teams and as expected it arrives as Teams chat in User B team

2020-09-05 03:50:54,Incomplete recording video download,"So I was to tasked to record our meetings but then after concluding it, it loads for some time and shows up an error that says: ""Recording failed to upload to Stream"". This happened to me the third time and I guess that will happen every now and then. I consulted our IT Support and they said that this was ""normal"" because they don't allow uploads to Stream (maybe as part of the rules of the Organization). 

So I had no choice but to DOWNLOAD it. And then it gets really annoying that everytime I download the video, I always get an INCOMPLETE one. The video gets to the latter part but it always gets cut. Plus, there is no indication of whether the download is taking place. We had to monitor the file size every now and then changing at the Downloads folder. The weird thing is that my teammate can download the video complete. No cuts, the video is complete until the end, full duration.

I have thought of a better idea by trying to use the web app version so that I can see the progress of the download and hoping that I would get a complete duration of the video. At the latter part of the download, when it is about to finish, the transfer gets to 0 and then it FAILS. I tried this method thrice, but go no luck.

Anybody experiencing this one?

2020-09-05 04:06:29,Adding Audio Conferencing to Teams Meetings on a Business Essentials License,"OK, coming over form Gsuite, where every meeting gets a web conference link AND a call in conference number, this is insanely painful.

We have a very small and simple org.  I basically only need one person to be able to create meeting with a call in number.  I really don't need phone service for anything else.  No direct numbers, no calling service.  I just want Teams Meetings, especially with outsiders (clients) to include a conference line.  

I've seen that the $4/mo Audio Conferencing add-on might work even though I don't have an E1-E3 license.  I've seen that I need to buy the $20/mo Business Voice product.  

Has anyone else gone through this situation and willing to give advice?

2020-09-07 01:11:39,Sharing documents in read-only,"I work in a large org (6000+ users) moving from G Suite to MS365 soon. 

I am thinking about how we are going to use Teams, etc. and replicate some of the things we do now. One of these in distributingh copies of meeting minutes to large sections in the part of the organisation where I work.

My own team (about 6 managers) meet regularly and collaborate on the agenda and minutes in google docs.  We will be able to easily do this in a MS Teams Team, using the Files tab and Word files.

However, when the minutes are finalised in MS Word, we need to share them with all the other teams in our division in read-only.   Currently, we do this using a Shared Drive in which permissions are set to read only for most colleagues except select managers. We uploaded all minutes here and this served as a library for all the minutes.  We uploaded the document to that Shared Drive and then shared it in Google Docs to all users in View Only mode, and they are then notified about the document.

I do not think we can easily do this in Teams. Even though there may be a MS365 group set up that includes all the users we want to share with, the problem is that by default anyone who is a member of a team has update permissions to any files uploaded to it.  From what I can make out, it is impossible to change this.

I wondered whether we could instead just finalised the Word doc (accept all tracked changes) in my own smaller team of managers, and then share that document in read-only to other users, but you can only do this by creating a URL, which then has to be shared with staff by e-mail - it's a backward step.

2020-09-07 15:11:01,Teams teambuilders?,"So I'm on the hook to provide a decent teambuilding exercise for everyone over Teams - mostly people on audio-only. 

The previous person did Who Am I, where they provide hints as to a famous identity, and team members *buzz* in when they think they know who it is. They did a couple of rounds, and gave out gift cards to encourage participation. 

There seems to be a real dearth of blogs etc about this, which is weird to me given the intense period we've all just been thru/are still going thru regarding very sudden changes to working from home. 

So - here goes:  
Game: **Who Am I?**  
Size of team: **5+, really as many as you want**  
Time: **5-10 minutes**  
Preparation: Moderator picks a couple of famous figures in advance. Try to make these a mix of sports, politics, music, movies etc - pick categories likely to satisfy as broad a cross section of your team as possible.   
Write hints as to the identity of you famous person: Start with non-specific, hard hints (year of birth, star sign, home town) then hints that correctly situate the *kind* of figure you're talking about (the sort of thing they are famous for, or specific quirky trivia points about the person that are slightly niche), and finally culminating in easier hints (the things that most people would immediately associate with the person in question, their batting average, the document to which they were a signatory, etc). Aim for about 10 hints total per famous figure.

When it comes time to run the event, explain the rules (team members to 'buzz' in using their voice, or the raise hand function if you find it reliable enough. People shouting out the answers are disqualified). Start with the hard, non-specific hints, read a hint out and wait a few seconds to see if anyone guesses straight away. Read through the hints, pausing to see if anyone has an answer after each hint.

2020-09-07 16:34:11,Microsoft Teams Breakout Rooms,"Just got into the office and seen that Breakout Rooms are coming for EDU staff in Public Preview. Hopefully this means that it's going to come for normal users soon too!

Here's what the message centre post says:

**EDU Public Preview of Teams   Breakout Rooms** 

Breakout Rooms in Microsoft Teams Meetings will be available to all EDU customers as part of   Public Preview. Breakout rooms allow meeting organisers to split main meetings into smaller sessions for focused discussions.

This message is associated with Microsoft 365 [Roadmap ID 65332](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Froadmap%3Ffilters%3D%26featureid%3D65332&amp;data=01%7C01%7Cben.bowker%40worldvision.org.uk%7C08dd9097b06540154db808d853079097%7Ccfb22647037f43b0b5b35e44e1aece7f%7C0&amp;sdata=C0IEg4eWL7hpY8xPr9E%2FYcdzc%2BGKHecR67WdRJIKJoo%3D&amp;reserved=0)

**When will this happen:**

We are targeting to make the Public Preview available for EDU customers by mid to late September.

How this affects your organisation:

Once available, follow the   steps below to setup and use Breakout rooms.

**Administrators**

1. As an admin, ensure users can schedule private meetings with the following settings:
   1. Allow scheduling private meeting = on
   2. Allow Meet now in private meeting = on
   3. Learn more about student safety: [Policies that should be assigned for student safety](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2FmeetingsafetyEduadmin&amp;data=01%7C01%7Cben.bowker%40worldvision.org.uk%7C08dd9097b06540154db808d853079097%7Ccfb22647037f43b0b5b35e44e1aece7f%7C0&amp;sdata=AxcCp58namWSLoCuLxRbr0RIWaZOLYqRs%2F4fshuvU3U%3D&amp;reserved=0)

**Educators and Students**

1. To see the breakout rooms option within your meetings, you must turn on the new Teams meeting experience by:
   1. Clicking on your profile image within Teams
   2. Selecting **Settings**
   3. Checking the **“Turn on new meeting experience”** option within General settings.
   4. Restart your Teams client.
   5. You can double check that the setting is setup correctly by starting a meeting and verifying that the meeting opens in its own window.
2. Make sure all participants, including the meeting organiser are using the latest version of Teams. If joining on Android or iOS mobile or tablet, make sure participants go to their App Store and download the latest update.
3. As a meeting organiser, join a private scheduled meeting or private meet now meeting. Once you are in the meeting you should see the breakout room option next to the raise hand control.
   1. You must be a meeting organiser to see the option. Meeting attendees and presenters will not see the breakout rooms option.

What you need to do to prepare:

As an admin, review and share the settings to ensure they are set correctly for your organisation  and your users. Additionally, you may wish to share the information below   with your Educators to help them prepare.

**What is available in  preview?**

Available now for the  meeting organiser:

* Breakout room setup on Teams desktop client
* Create breakout rooms in scheduled private meetings (including recurring) and private meet now meetings
* Meeting organisers can manage rooms and hop between rooms freely

* Create up to 50 breakout rooms in a single meeting
* Add, remove, delete breakout rooms
* Rename rooms to the title of your choice
* Reassign room participants from one room to another before as well as while the rooms are open
* Room transition: as an organiser, you can decide if participants get moved to the room automatically when you open the room, or, if they need to click to confirm the move. The “auto-accept” setting is available per meeting.
* Send an announcement that will show up as a meeting chat message in each room.
* Chats, files, and recordings: only the organiser will always have access to all rooms meeting artefacts

Available now for the   participants::

* Join breakout rooms from web, desktop, iOS, iPads, Android mobiles and tablets. Note that organisers cannot move participants who joined via Desk phones or Teams devices join to a breakout room, they can stay in main meeting as their breakout room.
* Participants join the room as presenters, so they can present, share Whiteboard, etc. freely.
* Participants cannot add others to meeting chat, copy meeting details, nudge others to the meeting, or use “call me back”
* Hoping between rooms: Meeting participants cannot hop back to main meeting or between rooms on their own. They must wait for the meeting organiser to pull them back to the main meeting.
* Chat during the breakout session. Chat and artefacts shared during meeting are viewable for room participants.
* Chats, files, and recordings: Participants have access to artefacts, but only organiser has access to the links – if link is shared by meeting organiser, then participants will have access
* Multi-device join: breakout room is not supported when the participant joins the same meeting and same account from multiple devices

**Where and when can I   set up breakout rooms?**

* In preview, you can set up breakout rooms after you join the meeting as the organizer. You can bulk create rooms at the start, or manually add or remove rooms.
* You can set up breakout rooms from desktop client, but not in mobile and web.
* We plan to enable the ability for you to set up breakout rooms before the meeting very soon.

**When can I assign   participants to breakout room?**

* You can assign participant when you are setting up the rooms. You can do so manually before the rooms open or reassign participants to a different room while the room is open.
* You can also auto-assign the participants to rooms when you first set up the rooms in the meeting.

**What is the ideal flow   for an educator to utilise breakout rooms?**

**Preparation**

* Join a test meeting to familiarise yourself with the breakout room experience, ask a colleague to test with you and take turns as organisers
* Test out breakout rooms with your students to ensure they are familiar with the flow

**Scheduling the meeting**

* Schedule a private meeting or start a private meet now. Channel meeting and channel meet now are not supported at this time.

**Before the meeting**

* Inform students that you will use breakout room in the classroom, ensure they have a way to contact you if they are running into issues, for example, monitor a channel post in your class team for any issues.

**At the start of the   meeting**

* Ensure students have joined, click on the breakout room icon to set up the rooms and participant assignments
* If there are students joining via phone, use the main meeting as their breakout room (as moving a participant who joined via phone to a breakout room is not supported at this time)
* Set the breakout room settings to determine whether students must first accept the room transition before moving between rooms, or if you prefer that they transition automatically when you open the rooms. The latter one is recommended to ensure students join the rooms you intended at the correct time.

**During the meeting**

* When the class is ready for breakout room, click to open the rooms
* If anyone joins late or needs to rejoin, make sure you assign them to the right rooms
* Participates join their breakout room as “presenters” by default, so they can share screen and interact freely. If you wish to limit their ability in the room, in preview, you can hop into the room and update their meeting roles

**While the breakout   rooms are open**

* Hop between rooms to check the progress of the group discussions
* You can also read meeting chats of each room in Teams, without hoping to the room first
* Send announcements mid-way or towards the end of the breakout session to notify your students o the time remaining or any other expectations you have for their discussion. Messages will be posted in the meeting chat of each room
* If any students get dropped from the breakout room, make sure you assign them to the right rooms

**Closing the rooms**

* Go back to the main meeting, and click close rooms, students should be brought back to the main meeting
* Students will be removed from the meeting chat of the room; they can still see the past chat history but they cannot post nor receive new messages in the meeting chat

**After the meeting**

* In preview, you can get the recordings and attendance report of each room from its meeting chat
* You can collect the recordings or other artefacts from each room and share out to the entire class",1.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/io3u3y/microsoft_teams_breakout_rooms/,unreadymarmot

For some reason recently, when we are doing a scheduled meeting, the (I believe) first person that connects ends up taking up the entire viewport.  

We have a regular staff meeting which I schedule for our faculty / staff team.  I set it so only my account presents (since I’m the one with the system in the main meeting room for our remote locations to experience / participate in).  Usually I schedule the meeting for our standard start time, by the time we are setup and connect (usually a couple minutes before the meeting start) - most people are already signed in (usually between 4 and 10).  For some reason, the same person ends up being the only person displayed in the view field.  I checked and his feed is not pinned.  His feed ends up being main display for all members and I have to tell everyone to pin my stream to make his go away.  

A few weeks ago the display on my side would show up to 9 participants and if they didn’t have video feeds it would just show a square with their initials; but now it’s not doing it.  Plus its weird that it’s happening to every one else in the team.

I’ve verified that this person is using their own account and I checked my meeting settings and I was set as the only presenter.

If we try to view anything else in teams, instead of minimizing their screen, it just disappears. They then have to disconnect from their end and share again if they want us to see again.

Then they can listen to their own music or something while working, too.

They can't just leave the meeting because to be counted as present they must be in the meeting the entire time (dumb school rule in my opinion but w/e).

I have got MS teams working with Kamailio for outbound calls. SIP Signalling looks correct and audio works both ways testing 10 minutes plus with no issues.

Where I'm not sure if there is an underlying issue is when I looked at sngrep there seems to be weird things going on with RTP. The streams appear to be starting and stopping then showing unassigned.

For inbound calls to MS Teams I see no such behaviour.

It's using RTPEngine to handle media so that MS can be SRTP and my network remain RTP.

Please see image. It doesn't look right but the audio is fine, so not really sure where to start looking.

Each chapter is it's own office and serves its local area, some of which are pretty remote. Many of these chapters have requested that we find a way to help them connect so they may support one another. So what I'm looking for is a way to allow these offices to communicate and share ideas and resources - in essence create an online community. I've set up Discourse and so far it's not getting a lot of traffic from users at the moment, but it's also pretty new to everyone. One complaint that I've received is that Discourse requires users to log into to the site and so people forget about it. One member suggested using MicrosoftTeams because it's always open on their computer. But does Teams allow users to share in an open space like Discourse's forum format? My experience with Teams suggests that it excels at allowing specific teams of people to easily collaborate on a given project and bypass the headache of emailing back and forth. But in our case we don't have a specific project or a specific set of teams. However the forum format of Discourse, like reddit, lets people post a question and then any user who sees it can choose engage if they desire. Teams doesn't seem to be built for this need, but maybe I'm wrong.

2020-09-13 01:00:56,How to make old meetings unavailable,"Hi, 

I wonder if there is a way to keep people from joining an old meeting that has passed.

I have hundreds of students joining meetings for live online Uni classes once a week. Students are still dropping and registering for courses, so I am making a new meeting every week so that all of the new students in the Team are invited to the meeting when I book it. The issue I'm having is that some students are joining the old meeting at class time instead of the proper, new one. I've ""cancelled"" the meeting but it is still possible if you go to the meeting details (and I imagine if they click ""join"" from an old invitation? I've also changed the description of the meeting to tell students not to join, and left a message in the chat of the old meeting, but still, there are so many people that someone is bound to make this mistake again.

Any ideas on how to funnel everyone to the correct meeting?

2020-09-13 12:55:08,Advice for Teams/integrated tools I should use in Teams setup for internal/external case management of a person with a disability (I'm the carer),"I am a carer for an adult with a disability. I get emails, documents, audio &amp; video files, instructions from 4 - 5 professionals on a weekly basis that I need to share with multiple disability support workers that are directly involved in the person with a disability's day-to-day care. At present we have a WhatsApp group that only includes the support workers and me, a bunch of google docs shared by the professionals that no one is really accessing or updating.

The person has daily 'homework' from professionals that change every week and her support workers have to help the person I care for to do this homework. The support workers and I regularly email/text/call each after sessions to provide progress updates for the person in care (which is just too much for me. The person in care cannot manage their calendar independently and relies heavily on the reminders from those calendar entries that are synced to multiple iOS devices and G-mail calendars.

I have just set up Microsoft Teams but I'm not overly savvy with it. All professionals were on board with this to my surprise. I'm happy to pay for whatever Microsoft subscription will allow this to work. I also am aware that some of those joining might not have a paid Microsoft 365 account, though based on what I have read - they will still be able to access, upload documents to, and fully participate in the Team - is this accurate?

***What I hope to do in Teams***

**1. Have a centralised calendar accessible and editable in TEAMS viewable by both support workers, the person in care and myself (carer). The calendar in Teams should sync with the calendars that the individual has on their iOs devices and student Outlook account calendar (one email address is for their personal Gmail and the other is a student Microsoft 365 email address). I'm hoping TEAMS calendar changes will update the person's iOs calendars on all their devices and on their Outlook student calendar.**

**2. Have separate channels, with only those involved in a particular channel to access the information in the channel that they are assigned to.** \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**Side note - Should I be setting these up as separate TEAMS instead of channels, why?\*\*\**

**3. Be able to meet via video/audio and chat with specific channels or individual people for scheduled catch-ups using Teams.**

**4. To directly record and store audio files in Teams for daily speech therapy practice playback by the person in care and her support workers/therapist**

**5. Every week, new meetings require updated case notes and new homework. I had created a Wiki file for case notes but the workers and therapists are not using this, they are uploading new word document to 'files' each day and then others are missing these updates in the newly dated file. I fear that list of files will soon become very long and confusing.**

**Are there are better ways to set up an easy to access and follow record of:**

**A) Weekly minutes from multiple disciplines (within a specific channel)**

**B) Regular updates with action tasks from therapists that change every week**

**C) To manage a running checklist one linked to Excel and the other a chart currently in Word. There has to be a better way of doing the chart than one big ugly word doc?**

Please bear in mind that these are therapists and disability support workers and a person with a disability that are trying to make the best use of this. Hopefully all in one place finally! Most are not tech-savvy but COVID-19 has helped with the openness to it.

I am trying to create 600+ School Class Teams via PowerShell using the latest MicrosoftTeams preview module as I need to use the -Template EDU\_Class option. My script is fairly simplistic and have a simple CSV file with 2 values, TeamMailNickName &amp; TeamDisplayName for -MailNickName &amp; -DisplayName.

This works mostly OK but then the New-Team starts to time out and the Team is not created. I can see it has created an Azure AD group but nothing more. Issuing a Get-Team returns nothing. I've restarted PowerShell ISE and then authenticate again and get-team still returns nothing. 

My questions are,

* Is there a time-out on the number of Teams that can be created at a time?
* Can the Team be created using different methods? Please keep in mind I would like to still assign a template to the Team.
* Is there any way I can create a Team, assign new owners without having to then remove myself as Team creator once complete?
* The preview new-team takes an age to create a team when it does work, can this be speeded up?

It may be quicker for me to create the Teams one at a time rather than try to troubleshoot issues during automation.

One user wanted to access Teams on multiple computers under multiple users and ended up following the prompts to download the Authenticator App. The problem is, this is a business account not a personal account. 

Now every time she tries to sign in it asks for her Authenticator, which only lists Azure AD and fails when she tries to sign in as 'personal account doesn't exist'. 

Any idea how I get her back on the team using her work Microsoft login and get rid of the Auth and all the personal stuff it is trying to force on her?

...but doesn't say WHY they can not support it. Is it just an immutable fact of life? Or is it just something they've decided they're not going to do?

The problem for us is we bought over 100 VVX 411s only three years ago as part of a project to move to SfB. Of course not long after that MS announce that Teams will be supplanting SfB, so we have to move to Teams. Moving to Teams itself isn't such a big deal as it is better than SfB, but what is a problem is the cost of replacing all those - basically still new - phones. We're a registered charity, and even without the reduced income due to Covid, this represents a significant expense, not to mention dreadful land-fill wastage of otherwise perfectly good phones!

Most of my users have Teams installed on their mobile devices and aside from using the microsoft password reset link the only other way to reset your password is by calling the helpdesk. 

Does anyone have any recommendations or can someone point me in the right direction?",1.0,3.0,1.0,33.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/iv4ckd/a_bot_for_self_service_password_reset/,DekaoTheRAmar
2020-09-18 20:43:13,Microsoft Teams Recordings," Hi, I'm a teacher using Teams, during the first few weeks the app was working perfectly as I could see the recordings uploading to Stream and posting themselves on each one of my classes, but after August 20, 2020 this function became unavailable forcing me and my coworkers to download the recordings to our computers and then uploading them manually to Stream and then posting the link for the video on Teams, this was ok the first day but doing so during various classes became tedious as we were also experiencing issues with Stream not fully uploading the video, so we opted to tell the students to download and view the recordings when they had a chance, it worked fine for about two weeks but now we started to receive complaints from both the students and the parents that the recordings weren't available or got an error message stating the video could not be played on their device, I began investigating and most of the students access their classes through an Iphone, Ipad, Android Phone, Android Tablet or Chromebook and I noticed that little by little these devices became incapable of downloading and playing the class recordings, so I would like to know if something is happening with the Teams app or if there is a workaround for this issue as most of the students at my school depend on these recordings for parents to help them understand their assignments and work with them.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/iv5cso/microsoft_teams_recordings/,SnooRobots8922

2020-09-19 00:34:57,Declined Meeting - Still Getting Chats,"We have users that have declined a Teams meeting (meeting created in Outlook and sent to distribution group). Once the meeting has started, users are getting chat notifications on these meetings they declined (aka don't care about).

My personal experience... I have the Meeting chat notification option turned on called ""Mute until I join or send chat"". So the way this is working - I do not see chat notifications in my ""Activity"" area of Teams. BUT I still see the chat and get bold chat notifications in the ""Chat"" area of Teams. This becomes super annoying for myself and all our users especially for these declined meetings. It clutters up Chat.

The only way to ""resolve"" it currently is to Leave the meeting and/or Hide the chat. But you have to do this on each individual meeting. During training season for us - you could have to do this for several meetings a day. Very annoying.

Has anyone experienced this and found a good solution for hiding chat on all declined invites?

For our new users that we add its not hard to just add the Teams number in the process of user creation. But we have hundreds of existing users that we don't want to go through and change the number on their AD account from their extension to their new direct line. The new numbers already show up in Teams but not in Outlook or anywhere else. Does anyone have a powershell script that can grab the users number from Teams and automatically add it to the Work Number section of the AD user?

2020-09-19 02:21:07,Move from S4B To Teams Direct Routing-Auto Attendants and Resource Accounts,"Currently we are Skype 2015 and are starting a project to move to DR. In Feb Microsoft forced us to build new Call queues and auto attendants in Teams when they killed of EXUM. So as it stands today our resource accounts (RA) are hybridapplicationendpoints created via Skype 2015 powershell. Everything is working today, as we move to DR we obviously want to remove Skype, so today i was testing building a new RAs direct from Teams admin center ( or powershell) but when i go to assign a on premise phone number to the RA i get an error that says:

&amp;#x200B;

This cmdlet is for online domain only. Please run corresponding on-premises cmdlets for on-premises domain.

\+ CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) \[New-CsOnlineApplicationInstance\], InvalidOperationException

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This obviously tells me i need to create the RA on premise ( like we did in February) my major concern here is what happens when we turn down Skype next year after were 100% teams, will these RAs break? I see them stored in Active Directory so i am hopeful that Skype is just the origination point. If thats the case I have no issues as we arent getting rid of on premise AD and that would actually mean less work for me as i wouldnt have to create new resource accounts or even update call queues and auto attendants.

2020-09-19 06:44:41,Can't share iPad screen and output to VGA or HDMI simultaneously,"I'm trying to use Teams to deliver classes to both online and in person students.  The in-person students need for my materials to be projected up on the screen, and the online students need the same resources shared via Teams.

Also, I need two apps - Powerpoint, and a 'whiteboard' app for 'writing on the board'.

My plan was this: 

1. Start a meeting in teams on my computer (Macbook Pro).
2. Join the meeting in Teams on my iPad Pro under the same acct.
3. Open Powerpoint and Notability (for whiteboard) on iPad.
4. Plug iPad to projector via Lightning to HDMI adaptor.
5. Share screen on iPad to teams, so that online users see my iPad screen. Then teach as usual, using use the home button to swap between Powerpoint and Notability as needed.
6. Simultaneously, connect my lightning to HDMI adapter to the iPad to present my iPad screen on the projector.

Sounds simple, right?

So I tried it, and get as far as trying to share my iPad screen.  While plugged in to the HDMI, I cannot share my screen. My screen is happily displayed on the projector though.  I get to the 'start broadcast' page, and I can click away and nothing happens, no countdown. The button flashes white, so I know my press registered.

If I then unplug the HDMI cable (adapter is still plugged in), I can share fine no problem. If I share this way, and then plug in the HDMI cable after I've successfully shared, the projector is all black, no screen share.

It seems that the iPad will either share with Teams, or output to HDMI, but not both.  But I need both!

\*I tried as well with a Lightning to VGA adapter and exact same problem. It's not an adaptor problem.

\*I tried two different projectors, so its not a cable problem or something to do with the projector. Both work fine under simpler circumstances.

\*I have no trouble sharing the Powerpoint app alone directly through teams, and it is shared both with online users and via the projector. But the same thing doesn't work if I select the ""share screen"" option. I want the screen share because I need the 'whiteboard' functionality and the abilty to swap between the two.

\*Other things I've tried to achieve the same goal: Share the iPad screen just to the projector, and then set up a camera to film and stream the projector screen on my Macbook Pro.  It looks great on the screen, but terrible for online users.

\*I've also tried sharing the iPad to teams only, and then projecting Teams to the projector via the MacBook Pro. It looks great for online users on Teams, but looks like trash up on the projector, since Teams downgrades the quality some, plus about 30% of the screen area is wasted on the Teams buttons, etc., that I don't need projected.

1) why does neither the join code or link work?
2) does being a private channel have anything to do with that? Is it to do with it being a university account, and our privacy policies? I've looked in pending requests for the Team and there's nothing there.
3) how do I fix this? Will I have to manually add all students?

we currently have directly routing trunks to MS Teams, we are using an Oracle Acme Packet SBC as our Gateway.

Our direct routing trunks are multi-tenanted and shared by multiple customers.

For some reason , the Ms Teams Trunks (SBC Session Agents) will go out of service for unknown reason and this is happening at least once every 2 months. 

The fix that we normally do is bounce the MS Teams trunk on the SBC or reboot the SBC even. Most of the time we thought that MS is doing some changes in the background the reason why its happening

I join in through the meeting link on my laptop and mute my mic and camera is off. For audio I phone in through my iphone with a headset and mute myself through my iphone.

My question: I am muted both on my laptop and on my iphone, but my phone number keeps showing up with the list of those who most recently spoke at the bottom (where it shows initials of who's speaking or their video). Sometimes my phone number even lights up when I'm muted and not even making noise.

My friend/coworker is on the call, and my number shows up at the bottom for her as well. We did a ""test"" where I cleared my throat to see if she heard, and she didn't. 

Also, when looking at the Participant list, our phone numbers show up as ""unmuted"" on the teams meeting session on our laptop even though we've muted our phones. Is this just a glitch?

Is the bottom row specifically for people who've most recently spoken? If so, why is my number showing up when I'm on mute? It's weirding me out lol

We installed a MeetUp and Logitech Tap in our CEO's office. The system signs in to Teams via a room resource account I set up in O365, then the CEO has his own account with an E3 license. 

We essentially want it set up so if somebody send him an invite, or modifies an invite that the invite will also show up/update on his office Tap. 

My current solution is pretty basic, but I wanted to check for feedback from more experienced users on this first. My current solution would be to set up a rule on the CEO's mailbox to automatically forward invites to his room kit. Then the organizer would receive an accept email from the room mailbox and the CEO's. This is super basic and easy to implement, but are there any limitations I should be aware of with this right now?

Please delete if not allowed but I have seen a hell of a lot of people facing the record button greyed out/Can't record in teams issue with little help from MS support. Here's what I figured out with my clients org:

So much time speaking to Microsoft surrounding this and being told it should work and that all my policies were correct etc. (They now haven't responded to my questions for two whole days now and were having me run PS scripts that would fail every time). I ended up figuring this is what our issue was (at least this fixed it for us and tested with an end user with the usual permissions etc across the board.

1. Firstly check your version, update that to the latest. Now, when you join a call/meeting does your call window have the toolbar in the middle of the screen? If so:

https://preview.redd.it/sd8kpeh2w4p51.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc2f61cc81a83f37828ed1e3835cd9880de0909e

1. Hit the circle in the top right corner with the accounts initials and then hit 'Settings'

https://preview.redd.it/j48bxul3w4p51.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46dea2f11a7aeb1662ceab637b5664d60dc61fa6

1. In your settings here, is the checkbox '**Turn on new meeting experience (New meetings and calls will open in separate windows. Requires restarting Teams.)**' turned off? Ours was. If you tick the box, reboot your teams app and join a meeting or even make a new direct call, your call window should look different with the toolbar in the top right. Hit the three dots, 'Start Recording' should be active now.

Obviously you need to have all your admin settings right also (make sure to check stream permissions regarding uploads to stream being enabled as well as teams policies. Something else MS never asked me to check). But have spent way too long on this and it was as simple as that so I had to reach out to whoever might be facing the same issue and here's hoping this solves it for you as well. Up your game MS.

Having a few issues with setting up Teams for a school. I'm in the 'keen amateur' tech level, and looking at practical usage for staff. We've hit a number of issues, some of which seem to have multiple complaints across the internet, but wondered if people had good solutions/work arounds. Hoping you folks can help.

1. Sharing a single folder from another team. I've tried creating multiple folders in a department team, that I'd like to distribute to year groups; eg. have year 9, year 10, year 11 etc. in a Department, then share the year 9 folder to a year 9 class. If I copy across, the folder does not stay live, so any changes made in the dept. folder don't carry across to the year group (no good). I've also tried 'adding cloud storage'. Even if I select a link to a sub folder, I can only add the 'class resources' or 'documents' root folders. Finally, I tried adding a website link as a tab. This gave access to the folders, but also any other folders in that sharepoint (this may be because I already have access to all the other folders?)
2. Notifications. I'd like students to receive an email when a new assignment is set, but there does not seem to be an option for this. There are multiple posts online on this, but a lack of solutions or work arounds.

I work for a small office and we set up the Microsoft Teams for all the employees. We created sub channels where we can track the calendar for the members of the channels. Most of my colleagues and I have been coping perfectly with Teams and only a few have the following problem.

When someone creates a new meeting (in Calendar) and adds a channel so the invite is broadcasted to all the members of that channel most of us receive an email regarding the meeting while others just receive a notifications in the activity and a few don't receive any of the above (even though they are part of the channel).

Is there a way such that everyone receives the email with the invite regarding the meeting?

The problem I'm having is if I leave the microphone on the laptop un-muted in Teams in the fellowship hall so that students can ask the teacher who is online at home can answer questions then I get a lot of echo for the teacher. The only way to fix this is for me to manually mute and un-mute the classroom whenever it seems the teacher is going to ask a question. As you can imagine this is quite difficult to manage. Is there a better way I can approach this so I do not have to mute/unmute the laptop in the fellowship hall?

It also does it when typing a message sometimes as I'll be writing but it won't show what I'm writing as it's frozen.  I type a sentence, hit enter, start typing another but when it unfreezes it just ignored the first enter and sends them together. 

It's mostly though just when switching chats.  Like it will be running totally fine, but you click a chat to switch to it and it's frozen for 5 seconds or so and then it's fine.  Drives me nuts, debating on formatting my machine but it's literally 3 months old and no other programs run slow.  It has done this with Teams from day one.

I've thought about having the employee start a meeting, and then taking their invitation url and accessing that from another machine, which does work, but unfortunately that url obviously changes after the meeting is ended/time runs out, which is the second issue.  We can't just keep the same meeting going that clients can drop in and out of since I guess there is the time limit of 24 hours, so we would constantly have to be updating the url.

Attendees will need the ability to vote on motions and to propose and vote on amendments during the meeting. My university uses Office 365 and Microsoft Teams.

Currently, the plan is to have amendments submitted and voted on days before the meeting and to have voting the day after the meeting via our in-house voting software. Obviously, this is not very efficient as it requires people to log on three times, so I'm trying to figure out if I could use Teams Meetings or Live Event more effectively.

Is there any way to allow both voting members and other non-voting students to attend, but to ensure that only voting members can vote? (We have a pre-determined list of voting members. We have to allow any person who has an account within the university organization to attend the meeting but not to vote.)

Is there any way to record the votes of each individual participant?

Can I set up polls in advance so I can quickly bring them up during the meeting (i.e. once debate on a motion has finished)?

How easy is it to set up a poll on the go? If someone proposes an amendment, would I be able to quickly set up a vote?

Discord has an independent mute/deafen and so do many other programs. If teams can't get the mute to sync properly I'd rather have the option of not syncing them at all!

2020-10-03 00:51:51,Outlook presence in non-persistent VDI," We are having an issue with Teams in a non-persistent VDI environment where presence does not work.  

Teams is installed machine wide on the golden master (ALLUSERS=1 and ALLUSER=1) and I can see it gets installed into Program Files. The meeting add-in correctly loads for users, however it appears the registry keys for the presence plugin do not. 

&amp;#x200B;

  When installed per user the registry settings for Uc.tlb get added here: HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\TypeLib\\{B9AA1F11-F480-4054-A84E-B5D9277E40A8}  

&amp;#x200B;

However when done machine wide the keys get installed into: HKEY\_USERS\\.DEFAULT\\Software\\Classes\\TypeLib\\{B9AA1F11-F480-4054-A84E-B5D9277E40A8}  

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a bug, as the "".DEFAULT"" registry key does not get copied to user profiles, this is for services running as the local system. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've manually copied the keys into my user's registry and it seems to fix it, but it didn't for another user we tested with.

Some users are using a zero client and VDI and have a physical 3PIP phone (VVX 400/500/501s). The PBX users do have on-prem Skype accounts but they're not Enterprise Voice. They're set to audio/video disabled. 

We're having difficulties getting internal calls to route to the SBC. When we call an on-prem PBX user, the call rings in the receivers Teams client instead of routing to their PBX phone number and ringing their desk phone. One way I figured out how to get around this was have the Normalization rule in Teams change the called number for those users to just their extension. So when I dial 1-234-567-9999, (which has been keeping the call in Teams), it changes the called number to just +9999. That seems to pass it to the SBC's which is able to translate it and route it accordingly. PSTN calls are being routed and working with no issues. 

The issue with this is when these users join a meeting and choose the ""Phone Audio"" option, it tends to translate the number to the 4 digit extension on the fly (before it is dialed) and it will not let you dial a 4 digit extension. It has to be a 7, 10, 11 digit number to be accepted. 

We also have a similar issue with a Teams Only user who chooses Phone Audio and puts in their own extension. Their VVX phones will not ring. Only devices running an actual Teams client will ring. 

Any ideas to force calls to the SBCs? Our voice routes have our 2 SBCs enrolled.

2020-10-12 23:11:03,"Teams has no option to use system audio settings for output (e.g., speakers) and input (e.g., mic) devices. Why?","Like many organizations, my company uses a mix of various web conferencing software. I'm regularly using Webex, Teams, and Zoom. 


Both Webex and Zoom provide the option to simply use the default OS (e.g., Windows) settings for audio devices. That is, whatever devices you select for input/output, the application will respect that and use it, unless you specifically choose a different device. 


With Zoom, you simply select ""Same as System"" if you want to always use whatever devices you've opted to use at the OS level. 
This screenshot shows this:

https://i.imgur.com/WXCsWGg.png


With Webex, it's basically the same thing - you select ""Use System Settings"" and it will use whatever you've selected to use across your system. Again, here's a screenshot to show this:

https://i.imgur.com/DOxKn1z.png


For me, depending on the type of call, whether I'm hosting, just listening, etc., I sometimes like to use my dedicated headset and I sometimes like to use my speakerphone. It's very nice to have a single place to manage which device I am using. I even have hotkeys set up to switch between these easily. That way, I always know which speaker/microphone I'm using and I can quickly change it without having to get into the application-specific audio settings.


Despite that being a standard feature for these applications, Microsoft has, unless I am missing something, neglected to offer that option. You would think that since they also own the actual OS that many users are using, they would support using the OS setting that users have always used to manage their devices. 


Does anyone know if there has been a push for Microsoft to add this feature? Is there some reason they haven't already done this? Is there something I can do to help this get attention? Surely I can't be the only one who thinks this is a problem...",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/j9smlj/teams_has_no_option_to_use_system_audio_settings/,grt3

2020-10-13 03:45:16,What did we do to deserve this?,"Look, I'm not an IT guy. I'm not a PC expert by any stretch of the imagination. I'm just a long time Windows user. I've never really had major tech issues with most Microsoft applications. I loved Windows. If you asked me if I thought Microsoft should design a chat app, I'd think they were more than qualified. That being said, this abomination of a program should be sent back to hell where it came from. 

Teams was forced upon my dept at the start of the Pandemic in March at the very large auto insurance firm I work for to replace Skype for Business that we had zero problems with since I joined in the start of 2019. Since then, what a shitshow this stupid program has been. The only time I've heard someone say they liked Teams was when they realized they could send gifs. Otherwise, it's been nothing but a problem. We have to connect to our company network through a company VPN remotely due to the pandemic. So some of the joys of Teams have been EXTREME lag times (pulling more than a gig of RAM on my new work issued HP Elite book Core i5 vPro 8th gen, effectively overheating it), unable to search chat history without freezing and forcing me to shut it down, messages not sending at all, messages saying they sent but didn't until I close and reopen the app, unclearable notifications, images never loading in chats, random freezing, microphone and audio device glitches and malfunctions, too many users in a meeting causing presenter video to lag so they're forced to turn off video altogether, etc, etc, etc. 

It's like some kind of terrible joke. Every day if I'm having tech problems, 4/5 times it's being caused by Teams. Some coworkers gave up altogether and went back to Skype until our IT department gets rid of it permanently (a day every single person on our team dreads). I really have no idea what I can do to try and work more effectively with this program as a user. Today I couldn't load, receive or send messages at all. I task manager closed Teams and reopened 4 different times and nothing improved. Tried restarting. Tried disconnecting and reconnecting VPN. I found out they have an online version of the app which is getting me through for now but still plenty of lagging. But the desktop app still doesn't work. Any suggestions for how to get through working with this POS in the coming months? This program has made my job insanely difficult because I train people in our dept via webcalling and IMs (yes FML).",1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/j9y0b4/what_did_we_do_to_deserve_this/,theyhaveitsoeasy

2020-10-13 08:03:36,Does Teams affect the overall mic input?,"As the title says, that is the question. A while ago I started having terrible problems with plug-and-go microphones, whether it's an actually mic or my headset or God knows what, the computer would only detect the audio input at 2 to 4 percent.. which is ridiculous. The issues started happening during a Teams class meeting over the desktop app when I wanted to lower the calls volume. My mic worked fine before that, but after checking those settings I was suddenly told nobody could hear me anymore, I even reset them but nothing changed. The issues persisted and would even affect discord or obs. I tried a webcam with its own driver after that, and it sounded perfect, so I'd say nothing is broken. 

I checked absolutely all possible settings and levels, plugged them into different spots, even reinstalled drivers but nothing would help. Then I read that Skype could affect the overall input as a Microsoft app. Well, I don't use Skype, tried regardless, no use. That's when I realized MS Teams is, well, obviously a Microsoft app itself and came across posts that said the app (not the browser version) would automatically adjust settings and that you can't seem to change it. There was no mention of it going beyond the App itself from what I read, but I suspect due to the already mentioned facts, that this is the case. These posts also said one of the only possible ways to fix it is to put your PC into factory settings, which is obviously quite the disaster with a home PC.

So now is the question again: Does it affect the overall input? And if yes, is there a way to fix it that doesn't involve factory settings?

I'd have to unplug the USB cable and plug it back in to get it to work. Sometimes I could be heard, but I couldn't hear anyone else.

I'm looking for real world examples of how people use teams. For example, ""I use teams in a group of 10 with a BT headset on an external monitor"" or ""I use teams in a group of 3 with the PC microphone and an externally connected USB camera"" etc.

Can anyone give some scenarios in how they actually use teams as a consumer for personal or business? Also, have you notice things that should work which do not, or any bugs/issues you've experienced? 

Do users ever use Teams app then put the system to sleep or hibernate and then wake and try to connect to the same meeting? Is this a scenario anyone uses?

We are seeing some weird/new sign-in screens on users starting their Skype for Business Client, after migration from On-premises SFB to Teams Only.

We do not have our Exchange Online, so we need to run the Meeting Migration Tool post-migration, in order to make sure all meetings are migrated to Skype online.

But in order for the Meeting Migration Tool to work, the Skype for Business client must be running.

I'm starting to see some difference in the ""your organization is now using Microsoft Teams"" window - and not sure what to do.

This is what some users are seeing:

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/sfbhybrid/media/go-to-teams-page.png](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/sfbhybrid/media/go-to-teams-page.png)

[https://practical365.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Pic-1-2.png](https://practical365.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Pic-1-2.png)

It's only in the last picture the users are able to start their Skype for Business Client. From Microsoft, it should show the first one. But when did this change? It seems like is connected to their version of the Skype client. Because the setting is not following the user, but the client.

When we use word docs, people are forgetting to save it as a different name each week, and over writing our original document. I would love an app that lets me build/ upload the template, and it's saved with the date is was edited, without changing the original. 

3. Staff Photo &amp; Information template that can exported as a PDF for distribution as marketing materials.

i have some short questions...

PhoneTools is great, because you have a hotkey and when highlighting a phone number in our CRM-System (Mesonic Winline) and Ticket-System (Jira) it automatically sets up a call to the selected number. Somehow i am searching for a feature to do that in MS Teams aswell. Maybe there is something out of the box, i just don´t know etc.

Another Problem we are facing is that we want to integrate another LDAP (Metadirectory from ESTOS) to Teams, to search for Customer which are in this LDAP Directory synced from our ERP and CRM System. Somehow, i guess i will need some kind of LDAP-Connector to MS Teams here.

I'm part of a programming/curation team for a film festival, and we would like to do live watch parties of the submissions we receive so that we can discuss them in real time. I've used Discord in the past to do things like this with great success, the streaming quality on there is basically at the level of Twitch.tv or YouTube live. I was wondering if the screen sharing experience on Teams is as good? It would be convenient to keep everything on the Teams platform but if the video quality doesn't live up I would create a Discord server for these watch alongs.

If you've used MS Teams screen sharing before to watch videos together, I'd appreciate some input on what the quality and overall experience was like.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/jbuvr5/screen_sharing_quality/,peachscissors

I mostly use teams on desktop,  in a call center type job where I answer a lot if incoming calls. On desktop, everything works fine. If multiple people are calling at the same time they get placed in a queue and the call rings after I'm done with the current call.

Recently I've started using teams on android, so I can listen to a podcast or something while I'm not in a call.

However the queue on android does not seem to work well. I am sometimes in a call and teams starts ringing about the next incoming call, which is very disruptive. If I reject the call, it rings again in like 10 seconds.

Is this a known issue on mobile? Anyone know a way around this issue? I'm using the latest version of both apps, and I'm using the desktop version, and sometimes browser version at the same time, as I need them open for work.

2020-10-21 16:47:19,Using Teams with multiple domains,"We recently wanted to try Teams because of Covid and remote work. So I tried to use it with my company e-mail [""me@company.pl](mailto:""me@domain.pl)"" but got an error ""Someone has already set up Teams for your organization"". After many different solutions found on web I finally found out you need to create an account on Power BI and then do internal domain takeover, then you can administer it on [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com). We use multiple e-mail domains in our organization ""[company.eu](https://domain.eu)"", ""[company.fr](https://domain.fr)"", etc. I didn't think this through and created alias e-mail ""[me@company.eu](mailto:me@comapny.eu)"" and created new Power BI account with this account and then did internal takeover of ""[company.eu](https://company.eu)"" domain. But now I'm not sure I did the right thing because we want every user even from different domains to be able to cooperate with each other and not use guest access or anything like that. And let mi point out that we don't have any Microsoft subscription (we have Office 2013/2016/2019 retail editions) and we don't use any cloud Active Directory or whatever, only local Active Directory that uses ""[ad.company.pl](https://ad.company.pl)"". So with all that, here is the main question: Can I safely somehow remove/unlink ""[company.eu](https://company.eu)"" domain and remove account ""[me@company.eu](https://me.company.eu)"" and then link it to our main account/domain so I can add users with ""[company.eu](https://company.eu)"" and ""[company.fr](https://company.fr)"" e-mails?",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/jf97qw/using_teams_with_multiple_domains/,kapela86

2020-10-21 21:51:40,Disable Windows Toast Notifications on Specific Computer,"I've come across a minor inconvenience  (at least for me) that I was wondering if anyone else has ran into and had a solution for. My WFH setup might be a little unique, but I wouldn't think would be all that uncommon. I use my personal computer at home as a ""dumb client"" to VPN into the office then Remote Desktop into my computer at work, then I do my work from within that RDP session.

I have the Teams desktop client running in the RDP session for chats, messages, etc. while I'm working, but I also have the desktop client running on my local (personal) computer for phone calls (the client running in the RDP session doesn't work for phone calls because it doesn't have a mic available... I've played around with ""sharing"" my mic over the RDP session but the results weren't great). Anyways, as a result, I will be actively using Teams in the RDP session talking to people, and whenever someone responds, I get a Windows toast notification from my local computer because from my local computer's perspective, Teams is running in the background (despite actively using it on the remote computer). Is there a way to disable the toast notifications only on my local computer to prevent these notifications, without disabling them everywhere (so I will still get them on my remote computer when I'm not actively using Teams)? The settings within Teams look like they apply to my account and disabling them there would disable them everywhere. I checked the Windows ""Notifications &amp; Actions"" settings and saw several different programs that I could disable notifications for, but Teams wasn't listed.

2020-10-22 07:21:28,"Fringe use-case, advice needed","Here’s the issue: users are getting massive feedback loops because of non-existent noise/echo cancellation within Teams.

Here’s a quick rundown on the setup:
Teams meeting w/ video consisting of 6-8 users (could increase in the future) and 3-4 remote users. The 6-8 users are in a large room with no partition separation, semi-spread out (COVID), using a combination of company iPhones and iPads for the meeting. The remote users are also using iDevices of mixed flavor.

Caveats:
- Teams HAS to run on a dedicated device because they run a softphone for other calling software on their computer with a headset.
- Meeting HAS to have 1-to-1 video, not conference room style.
- Another earpiece/headset in the “free ear” (the ear not in use with the softphone headset) is NOT an option - been there/suggested that.
- iOS devices must remain plugged in...meetings last ALL day

Attempted solutions:
- Users mute mic when not actively talking - this works for the most part if they can remember to mute themselves (still a problem)
- Yealink VP59 Teams phone - thought behind this was to use the better mic built into the phone mixed with echo cancellation provided by the phone’s software...long story short the “Teams edition” firmware strips out this and many other functionalities


Unimplemented solution idea:
- Yealink CP700/900 or something similar - dedicated Bluetooth speakerphone/mic combo w/ echo cancellation paired to each individual iOS device



So that’s everything I can think of at the moment. The client recently moved over from Zoom to Teams and never had this issue with Zoom. I’m guessing this is because Zoom provides echo cancellation whereas Teams has yet to implement this.

At my organization we recently moved from using Direct Policy Assignment within Teams (using the `New-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation` cmdlet to mass assign permissions) to using Group-Based Policy assignment using dynamic security groups in AzureAD to ensure that the right users get the right policies.

This works well, but now we need to remove all of the direct assignments that were previously assigned, to ensure that everyone only gets the policies that are assigned to them via their group. Running `Get-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation` from the MicrosoftTeams Powershell module returns nothing. I know that I can run the following to mass-remove different policy types, meaning that they would default to their group-based assignment, or to the global policy:

    ""TeamsCalling"",""TeamsCallPark"" | % { Grant-CsPolicy -Identity USERNAME -PolicyType $ -PolicyName $null_ }

Or I can just hold a meeting immediately with the team.

There's no way to schedule meeting in a Microsoft Team?

I don't see any native integration on either side, and the hokey 'If This Then That' style 'integrations' I see suggested on TechNet aren't really sustainable.  

Currently, we're suggesting that our users generate a meeting in the Teams Calendar tab, copy all the relevant info, and paste it into a new meeting invite in Google Calendar.  The issue there is that you need to actually invite someone for the Teams meeting schedule to generate a meeting URL.  Plus it's a hassle.

Has anyone come up with a more elegant solution?  When we were on SFB, with persistent conference IDs, folks would just put their meeting info in a signature in Gmail, problem solved.

* USB webcam - attached to the monitor
* Ipad air 3rd gen, with procreate on

She's hoping to have the mac as normal desktop display, and simultaneously use her ipad with Procreate live drawing, and be able to share the drawing through teams. Is there a way of doing this?

My company is having issues since we connected our Google domain to Office 365 account. Now whenever we are invited to teams meetings, we have no way of connecting them to our calendar. Before we changed the domain from [domain.onmicrosoft.com](https://domain.onmicrosoft.com) to [domain.com](https://domain.com), we were able to invite our email address and have it show up on our Google Calendars. Now it will not allow us to invite our email since it is the owner of the meeting. 

Since the change, users have not received any incoming invites for Teams. They show up when checking email in Outlook but will not come through to our Gmail inboxes. I have tried setting up email forwarding and the invitations still do not come to the Gmail inbox. When they accept the invitation, it shows up on their local Outlook Calendar which we can follow on Google (though other people in the company cannot see this when checking the user's calendar). However, any invitation that the user makes will not show up on the Outlook Calendar. 

Are there any other GSuite/Google Workspace users that have figured out how to get Teams events to show on their Google Calendar? We would like to avoid switching back to the [onmicrosoft](https://domain.onmicrosoft.com) domain since clients think the invitations are spam when they receive them.

The default notification setting for a channel is to send notifications for mentions and replies, but not new conversations. How does that make any sense? Surely a new conversation in a channel is specifically going to be for the attention of all the members of that channel - if the message isn't intended for everyone in the channel, then surely the channel is the wrong place for the message, no?

My partner and I are both admins in different companies that use Teams for similar things - conversations amongst an IT support team. There are channels for accounts, for different projects, for certain clients etc. and we are both as confused about this as each other. I just cannot for the life of me fathom why it wouldn't be set to send a notification to everyone when there's a new conversation by default. Why would default behaviour welcome the possibility that people are going to miss the message if they've not specifically updated their notification settings! I'm clearly missing something.

getting an error for users in a team that i am trying to add into private channels of that same team. some work fine some do not?  cant figure out why?  


again these are ALL members of the Team i just need to make a private channel in the team for all internal users. no guest. thus my filter.  it works for some random users i cant figure out why.  MS documentation says nothing about - role ""member""    infact the examples say to not use the -role property to add the user as a member. and only use -role to specify owner or guest

    
    # conect to teasm online 
    Connect-MicrosoftTeams
    
    # GroupID for the Team
    $Team_GroupID = ""xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx""
    
    # get all 'members'   from a team
    $TeamUsers_Members =  (Get-TeamUser -GroupId $Team_GroupID | ?{$_.Role -eq 'member'}).User
    $TeamUsers_Members
     # get channels
    $TeamChannels = ( Get-Team -GroupId $Team_GroupID | Get-TeamChannel | ?{$_.MembershipType -eq 'Private'} )
    $TeamChannels
    
    Foreach($Channel in $TeamChannels){
        $Channel
        foreach($User in $TeamUsers_Members){
            $User
            # Add $user to all $Channel of $TeamChannels in $Team_GroupID #
            Add-TeamChannelUser -GroupId $Team_GroupID  -DisplayName $Channel.DisplayName -User $User
            Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
        }
    }

error looks like this  for users that fail.

I have ran ping tests on my desktop and see no reason there would be a delay or latency issues. Microsoft teams continues to tell me it's not them that is at fault for the latency. 

We are on the fence whether or not we want to try Ring Central at this point.

I was struggling to find a solution to how to make Teams, Skype for Business and the default Camera app to work with my camera. I'm using Elgato CamLink4K together with my Panasonic G80 camera, and it works in all other applications than the one I wrote above. Even regular Skype works.  


In the camera app I get the error message: 0xA00F4271 MediaCaptureFailedEvent 0x80070491, and I followed all the steps that was recommended to take by googling the error code and my specific situation. I even formatted my PC. Nothing worked.  


**So for others that might struggle with the same, even though I'm sure we're few, here's a workaround:**

\- Download Streamlabs OBS  
\- Make a new Scene and add your camera as a Source, you should now see yourself there I hope  
\- Go to Settings in Streamlabs OBS, and click ""Virtual Webcam"" and click ""Start Virtual Webcam"". This is a experiemental feature, and might create some weird lines etc, but at least it works.  
You can also go to [https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-virtualcam.949/](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-virtualcam.949/) and follow their guide. It should have the same results.  


Your Scene in Streamlabs OBS should now be found as a source if you look in your Teams/Skype for business settings.

I have the strange problem that my audio quality in Teams calls is really bad. The voice gets very metallic/robotic. This problem only exists in Teams and not when recording locally or using other popular software like Discord or Teamspeak.

While testing I noticed that switching to the original microphone input (in Teams) I don't hear the fans as well and the voice still is robotic, which is not the case for other software. This makes me believe Teams is applying a filter on my input which is unnecessary while I'm using RTX voice and I wanted to test if this is the reason my voice sounds worse than in other software.

In the settings I couldn't find any way to deactivate the feature, but I found an article that said there are different levels of noise suppression in Teams, so there has to be a setting somewhere.

First, close Teams completely.

# Enable the Developer Menu For Teams:  

- Get 7-Zip if you don't already have it
- Download this asar plugin for 7-zip: https://www.tc4shell.com/en/7zip/asar/
- Find the file `app.asar` (In `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\current\resources`)  
- Open that file with 7-Zip  
- Navigate to `lib/`
- Copy the file `appStateService.js` to a local folder (drag and drop)  
- Open the local file in a text editor (I use Notepad++) 
- Search for `isDebug`
- In the functions `isDebugModeEnabled`, `isDevMenuExtensionsEnabled`, and `isDeveloperMode`, add the following lines at the top of the functions:

- Replace the file in 7-Zip  
- Close 7-Zip
- Start Teams  
- Right-click the tray icon and the menu should be much larger now
- Near the top of the menu, there's a `DevTools` Menu, hover over that, and then click  `Open DevTools (Main Window)`  

# Modifying the CSS  

- If you've ever modified CSS in Chrome or Firefox, this window will look familiar.  
- Go to the Sources tab  
- Click the right chevrons (`&gt;&gt;`) and choose ""Overrides""
- Click to add a folder where the CSS overrides will be stored on your system  

- Now you can click the `Select an element in the page to inspect it (Ctrl+Shift+C)` button in the upper left, just below the Developer Tools window's icon.  
- The order of operations is weird for getting the ""Enable Local Overrides"" button to show up on the ""Sources -&gt; Overrides"" section
   - But I think if you go select an element with (Ctrl+Shift+C) it should appear on the ""Sources -&gt; Overrides"" section

- **Now this part is mostly trial-and-error and poking around trying to find the correct element to style**   

**This part applies to the ""Chat"" tab, for the ""Teams"" tab you'll just want to change the max-width element for the wrapping div, and maybe the chat box at the bottom**  

- For the main width, select a message line, and then look up through the parents until you see a `max-width` CSS attribute that has an absolute value, and change it to `100%`or just un-check it. 
  - This appears to be a div with CSS classes of something like `list-wrap list-wrap-v3 ts-message-list-container` 
-  For message widths, select a message element again and traverse up through the parents until you see a div with CSS classes like `item-wrap ts-message-list-item` - un-check the `max-width` CSS setting.
- For aligning your messages left, select a message element again and traverse up through the parents until you see a div with CSS classes like `ts-message-thread-body align-item-left`
  - Look for `justify-content` and change it from `flex-end` to `flex-start`
  - You may want to change the `padding-left` on this same element too, I set it to 5rem

- Once you get your CSS how you want it, you should be good to go until the next time they update the stylesheet.

This isn't a perfect guide, but it should give you a starting point to poke around. I can try to answer any questions if you have them.

2020-10-29 20:19:46,Finding out who turns the audio off and spotlights videos,"Hi, I'm a high school student and due to COVID-19 I'm currently using Microsoft Teams to attend my classes online.

During classes me and my classmates often turn off other participant's audios, we spotlight videos and also record classes; we have fun doing this and sometimes, we also kick ourselves out of the meeting. We do this because we know it's an anonymous thing and the teacher can't see who does what.

This morning, though, our PE teacher told us that yesterday, when all the teachers had a meeting with the Head Teacher, they said they can easily see who does the things I just mentioned, therefore we can get punished for that.

I always mute people when they're making noise or whatever, so now I would want to know; is it really possibile for teachers (or someone else, i don't know) to find out who mutes people and spotlights others' videos or are they just trying to scare us so we don't behave this way?

Is there any way for me, not as an admin, to see if I have audio conferencing other than seeing if it pops up when I try to schedule a meeting?

But it got me to wonder. Microsoft has a Microsoft Classroom to compete but now it's Teams for EDU. But there is no way to do the Teams for EDU unless you have a EDU account as a organization. 

With Google classroom you can use it for your free acct or a paid Gsuite/ G Workspace account and set it up. Alot of parents use Google or a Microsoft account. And you can add your students in there. But there is no way for a home school parent to be organized and grade via Teams for EDU.

Our organization was hosting a decently large Teams meeting of around 80 people and approximately 25 of the users were broadcasting video. Randomly throughout the meeting session, I noticed some users suddenly turned off video and reverted to their profile icon instead. I thought they were just turning off their cams temporarily but they hadn't. When asking around, some participants could see them and others couldn't. Eventually their video came back for me (and others) without any action taken however this pattern continued for a number of people throughout the meeting.

Today we ran another meeting with 12 people with all of us using video and the same issue happened...random people intermittently not seeing the video broadcast of other participants.

I am currently trying a number of scenarios to try and reproduce this issue but it's behavior has so far been too random to reliably reproduce.

We're all using the desktop client on Windows 10 machines (2004) and I've had everyone check for Teams updates. Everyone is working remotely and we do have a split tunnel VPN with O365/Teams traffic not part of the client routes.

While dabbling inside the console I found these settings (see pic). I am not sure if this is what could be messing with my inability to create the events, but none of these policies can be removed. Is this a default setting or has the provided done something fishy here?

Given the nature of the event and me being relatively new to the Teams universe this of course takes time in planning and testing - something I do not have. Since the event organizer is C-level and the chairman is also involved, they already said to go ahead and get a Zoom license but even though they don't care about the money I would prefer to keep the $2k in my budget and also not come out looking like a total incompetent.

We've set up a an AD Connect sync, so our users are synced to Azure AD, and we've enabled E3 licenses for the first batch of users. Mailboxes have not migrated, Exchange props are not being synced in AD Connect and Exchange is not yet running in hybrid mode. 

For all intents and purposes we do not use Exchange online yet (as we still have to put some things through compliance to run this).

I've understood that chat history is saved in the following manner:

Group-chat / channels - &gt; Microsoft 365 group mailbox  
One-to-one chat -&gt; Personal user mailbox

Questions

1) Since we do not have any user mailboxes in Exchange, am I right in assuming that \_no chat history is being kept\_ and stored since there is no mailbox to store it? 

2) As soon as the user gets his exchange mailbox migrated, will the chat history start saving into exchange?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/jns7t0/teams_oneonone_chat_history_without_exchange/,las3rr

For our candidates, I'd like them to have a simple experience. Imagine the interview runs for 6 hours, from 10am-4pm, with a break in the middle. I'd like them to have a single Teams invite. They join the invite, and they're done. They (virtually) sit in that room for the next 6 hours.

For our interviewers, I'd like them to each get individual invites to only the hour they are interviewing. So if Sally interviews from 3-4pm, she would get a 3-4pm invitation.

1. If I copy/paste the candidate's Teams meeting invite details (the 6 hour meeting) into a 3-4pm invite to Sally, Sally does not get a nice Join button in her meeting invitation.
2. If I send different invitations for every hour of our interview event (to the candidate &amp; each interviewer), then the candidate needs to switch meetings every hour, which is awkward.
3. If I give every interviewer the 6 hour invite, then I've messed up their calendars (by blocking off too much time), it makes it hard for them to know when they should be interviewing, etc.

However, we also have 2 other sub companies, [domain2.com](https://domain2.com) and [domain3.com](https://domain3.com).  The users need to have email addresses at both of those domains, but also Teams accounts.  All 3 accounts would be added to Outlook desktop.  All 3 companies need to be separate externally (internally I don't care if they can talk to each other or not as they are all the same users, it's more if we invite a customer to a meeting from [domain2.com](https://domain2.com) I don't want that customer to ever see any mention of [domain1.com](https://domain1.com) and vice versa).

So right now, a user will be logged into Teams with [domain1.com](https://domain1.com) and in Outlook if they send a customer a meeting invite, it uses that Teams account.  It seems like it uses whichever one the desktop app is signed into when sending a meeting from Outlook desktop.

What I need though, is the ability in Outlook desktop for the user to invite a customer to a meeting from [domain2.com](https://domain2.com) or [domain3.com](https://domain3.com) and still be able to easily join the meeting.  The problem we have is when testing this, you send the invite from [domain2.com](https://domain2.com) but when you try to join the meeting, because Teams is logged in as [domain1.com](https://domain1.com) it basically says you're not invited to the meeting or something like that.  So a user would have to sign out of Teams desktop, and then sign in with [domain2.com](https://domain2.com) or [domain3.com](https://domain3.com) to do the meeting.  Where that kind of sucks though is if they need to send a message to a user on [domain1.com](https://domain1.com) since that's our primary domain.  If I'm in the middle of a customer call and need to message someone, I basically need to log into Teams on the web with [domain1.com](https://domain1.com) to do it, so kind of confusing.  That's partially why I thought against multiple tenants, since at least a user logged in with [domain2.com](https://domain2.com) or [domain3.com](https://domain3.com) should be able to send a message to someone on [domain1.com](https://domain1.com). 

Just wondering the best or proper way to do this, or if this is the proper way to do it?  I just hate logging in and out of Teams because users get lazy and end their call but forget to sign out and return to [domain1.com](https://domain1.com)'s Teams account.  I really just want [domain1.com](https://domain1.com) to be the primary account used for Teams, but the ability to send Teams meetings from [domain2.com](https://domain2.com) and [domain3.com](https://domain3.com) and still join those meetings.

Hope that makes sense, thanks!",1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/jprowl/help_me_figure_out_how_to_have_multiple_users/,psykobunnyto
2020-11-08 14:21:56,Lite Client for Teams?,"The company I was freelancing for shifted to MS Teams. We were communicating earlier on Telegram which is super fast on both phone and desktop (Windows).

2020-11-09 01:36:43,Dial-in number for Teams Live Events (not Meetings) workaround,"I was just checking the status of this on uservoice but I also shared by workaround to get a dial in number for a Teams ""Live Event"".  The ""Live Events"" unlike Meetings do not have a dial in option except for presenters.  No way to dial in via cell or landline and listen to a ""read-only/hear-only"" stream of the Live Event.  

I figured it would be easier to find it here instead of uservoice comments so I am copy/pasting it below.  Any other ideas or modifications would be much appreciated.

Requirements:

1 extra MS Teams license with audio conferencing capabilities add-on.  

1 extra pc (decent enough performance to run Teams meetings

 

Quick Explanation: You will use a new Teams account and an available pc to relay the audio from the live event by sharing the live event in the Teams Meeting with the option ""Include Computer Sound"". Since the Teams meetings has a dial in option, it allows people to use the Teams dial in conferencing to hear a live event  via another pc that is relating the event's audio.

Create a new O365 account with MS Teams license and Audio Conferencing. When the live Event is created by another account, you will create a Teams meeting (not live event) with this new account for the same date/time as the live event. Send out the dial-in information ONLY as the dial in for the Live Event. Do not send out the Teams meeting link as this can confuse people.  5 minutes before the live event starts, use the extra pc and secondary account to launch the Teams meeting you scheduled. While you are leading the Teams **meeting** on the new account, share the video of the **live event** with the option ""Include Computer Sound"". Once the meeting starts, the people dialed into the secondary Teams meeting will not know the difference since they are only using their cell. As the live event happens, the audio is relaying through to the Teams meeting for audio only.

A couple of gotchas with this workaround:  
1. The users will be able to unmute themselves and start talking. Since it is relayed audio it will not be heard by the live event but will be heard by other dial in users. Someone needs to watch the Teams meeting for Audio relay to make sure to keep all muted.  
2. There is a 250 person limit on Teams meeting attendees. If you plan on having more than 250 dial in users this solution might not be the best  
3. Make sure the computer running the relay Teams meeting is wired to the network and has a strong internet. If If the audio is poor for the relay pc, all of the dial in users will experience the poor performance as well.  
4. When creating the meeting for the Teams audio relay, make sure it is not an account",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/jqfqxm/dialin_number_for_teams_live_events_not_meetings/,busted-it-guy

Apologies if this is a frequent question but I couldn't find anything on this. 

I know that MS Teams will automatically show you as away after five minutes without any activity on your computer, but if you manually set yourself to Away, I have noticed that the 'Time away' will continue to reset, but you will still be shown as Away. 

For example, a colleague of mine set their status manually to Away. They left it away for the entire work day and though they were using their computer throughout the day, their 'away since' time didn't reset.

A few days ago I was using Teams on my Acer Switch Alpha 12 for school and I opened it up to start my 2nd Period class. When it opened the window for it looked extremely buggy and it crashed which then caused many of my other applications such as File Explorer and Google Chrome to bug out visually. I then tried to close all of the applications but they did not close properly so I just shut down my computer. Now every time I try to start my computer back up it stays stuck on the Acer Logo with spinning dots. I have tried everything from using Automatic Repair to opening Windows in Safe Mode (didn't even open) to even using CMD Prompt in the Recovery Options to fix this. I have even tried to Reset This PC and Keep Files but due to a stroke of unbelievable bad luck, I don't have enough space to even do that and since I don't have enough space, I can't reinstall Windows either. I have tons of notes for school, family photos, songs, and videos on this computer and I can't bear to throw them away. At this point, the only thing I can think of is going to a professional to fix it or recover the data but I don't have that kind of money on me.

2020-11-09 22:29:59,Is a Teams meeting invite link always unique and only for those it was sent to? Or can anyone with the link join? And can I reuse the meeting link?,"Just trying to wrap my head around how Teams does this.  With Zoom you have the meeting URL with the host and member code, so anyone in the company can just send that to a customer, including just via email without actually scheduling something.  It always reminded me of [join.me](https://join.me) or other conference services where you could literally just be on the phone with a customer trying to explain something and then just be like ""here Mr Customer let me show you what I'm talking about, go to [www.zoom.com](https://www.zoom.com) / yadda yadda to see my screen.""

With Teams it seems like the only way to get the join meeting link is by having that specific user send the invite out.  That invite that goes out, is that a different link each time and is it just for that specific time the meeting was sent for?  And secondly, what happens if someone who wasn't invited gets the link?  Would it let them join still or do you have to be specifically invited?

[the ... is greyed out. just says Message Extensions...](https://preview.redd.it/p2kih5gvd9y51.png?width=325&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd221868b05991c992969261f1d38b76cc9a0f51)

But if i turn off New Meeting Experience, or use the Web app (In Edge Chromium), I am able to use Apps in a meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

[full apps functionality here](https://preview.redd.it/um06tzs3e9y51.png?width=465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2101d932f0e5c79eaed670130b3334bc096c7648)

Is this expected behaviour? Has Microsoft announced anything about New Meeting Experience and the ability to use apps during meetings?

2020-11-10 15:32:58,NDI resolutions,"Hi all.

I'm trying to figure out a way to use Teams NDI for our current studio setup, which in total works fine. But, has anyone done any testing as to how the NDI reacts when other people joins the call and leaves? I see a lot of changing in resolution on the participants NDI streams. When joining a call with only one other I get the participant as 1080/30p, but as soon as I let in another it jumps down to 960x540/30p for each, and then down again when I exceed 4 participants (which will make sense if the total canvas for the output of participants is 1080/30p) 

Has anyone done any further testing on this that can be shared? Microsoft documentation on this is no where to be found, at least to me? :)

The next problem I have is the actual change in resolution, does anyone have a solution on how to keep a canvas size (1080/30p for example) and have Teams do the scaling internally, or do that somewhere else, the changing resolutions is a problem for the conversion to SDI as that will have to resync everytime Teams changes?

2020-11-11 07:48:10,Is there a way to actually force Teams to update?,"On one of my Windows VMs I have the Teams installed. When I look at the version number, it says that 1.3.00.26064 was installed on the 16th of October, but I know a newer version (1.3.00.28779) is available.  When I get Teams to do a manual check it says I have the latest version.

If I look at the Teams logs, I can see the URL that it fetches when it checks for updates and when I put that into a browser, it gives me a JSON file that says that yes, version 1.3.00.28779 is available.  But in the log it says that no update is available.

So what is going on?

Further investigation:

Checking for updates creates a zero length x64.json file (the same name as the one fetched) in %appdir%\local\roaming\Microsoft\Teams\tmp

Possibilities:
1) something in Teams is caching x64.json way longer than it should.
2) Teams sends additional data with its request (cookies/post info?) which is resulting in the server returning a zero length file when Teams requests it (or possibly a file which shows the current version as the latest) based on some policy - possibly phased rollout?

My evidence for the latter is that there’s mention in the logs of a “staggering” policy and “jitter” values for normal updates and hotfixes and phased rollouts would explain why machines get updated at seemingly random times.

In the end it’s very frustrating that “check for updates” doesn’t actually check for updates - I’m reminded of the way Android used to do phased rollouts where the manual check was effective once a day.  Is there a setting to fix this?

It’s a mild security issue because Teams is based on Electron and vendors various libraries which have regular security issues (e.g. FFMPEG, and more recently, one assumes, FreeType) and it’d be nice to force regular (e.g. daily) updates as it’s not clear how exposed these are.

Indeed, there’s an unspecified RCE in Teams in today’s MSRC bulletin and it’s concerning that for myself and more worryingly the users I support I can’t roll this fix out if it becomes an issue.",1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/jrwnru/is_there_a_way_to_actually_force_teams_to_update/,Lumpy-Research-8194

2020-11-11 08:19:06,Banner notifications no longer display on top of applications,"Hello everyone, hope you're all doing well.

My partner has been working from home for over half a year now using a Remote Desktop client to access her work computer and Microsoft Teams to communicate with other members of her team. A few days ago she noticed that while using her RD client in fullscreen mode (which is what she always does), banner notifications would no longer appear over the application, causing her to miss a handful of calls and messages. To clarify - the notification is playing out: the notification sound chimes and if you minimize the RD client quickly enough you can see the banner on the desktop; a week ago, however, there would be no need to minimize as it would show on top of the RD client, even in full screen mode. To make matters more confusing - sometimes, if she is switching between the RD client and her own desktop, new messages will display banners over the RD client briefly. Other times, while on her own desktop, the banners will be blocked by other applications on the screen.

I'm not extremely fluent in the Teams software but I'm pretty well versed with PC hardware/software, so I've checked all of the relevant (and non-relevant) settings in Teams, I've ensured Focus Assist and do not disturb modes are disabled, reinstalled the application a handful of times, and switched accounts. Windows (10 Professional) is updated to the latest build, as is Teams. Nobody else from her workplace is experiencing this issue, and nothing about the hardware setup has changed except for a power board switch which I cannot see being related in any way.  
I'm not sure where else to turn as this issue is pretty detrimental to her work and though I've seen similar issues mentioned online I'm still yet to find any solution. I have a feeling this has something to do with Microsoft pushing some kind of Windows toast notification X Teams banner notification hybrid and they've mangled the rollout, but I'd be glad to hear it's just a setting I've overlooked. Hopefully someone here can help.

Both Windows 10 and Teams are on their most recent builds. My partner is running a dual monitor setup and remoting into a dual monitor setup, and the PC she's using consists of a Ryzen 1600, RX 580 and ROG Strix B450-i. I can provide further details if necessary.

We have audiocodes virtual SBCs setup with a new trunk connected to our SIP provider, this is working and in ""production"" for 25 pilot users.  Prior to cutover our sip provider will be increasing the capacity of the new trunk and migrating TNs from trunk 1 to trunk 2 which is connected to the new SBC. Until cut over weekend (thanksgiving) we will route these numbers back to our existing SBC to ensure no loss of calling ability. All affected users have been assigned voice routes, dial plans, cloud voicemail and enterprise voice, as well as ensuring they have the proper O365 license. 

We have multiple methods of communication and training we will start pushing next week as well. Our cut over plan is to migrate the users from Skype to Teams via Powershell/Control Panel, then we will register our existing AudioCodes MediaPacks to the new AudioCodes SBC, we will also build new resource accounts and connect those to our existing Teams auto attendant as the current resource accounts are hybrid endpoints. We will also update our fax solution to point to the AudioCodes SBC. After the migrations complete ( 48 hours or so) we will sign in our common area phones and conference room phones and head onsite to do physical testing of said devices.

&amp;#x200B;

We will also push a policy update to disable skype from running at startup on effected machines, and update our 911 provider with a new script to ensure it is pulling the correct  TNs from Teams. We will be using our existing VVX phones for the time being and communication on how to sign into those will be provided as well to users, although most users are remote.

\- We are currently creating the Assignments for our classes ourselves, including physically creating the rubric for **every** assignment (which is very time consuming!).   
\- We want to be able to all collaborate together to create an assignment and then the teachers can easeasilyy copy+paste this into their own class team. 

Is there any way to do this? We've experimented with importing rubrics via a cvs file (which has its own complications) and can also see that you can create an Assignment 'from existing', but this doesn't work as one teacher doesn't teach all ten classes and therefore don't have access to assignments that other teachers/team owners have created.

Any help is really appreciated!",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/jsr438/im_a_teacher_and_would_greatly_appreciate_your/,MrTeacherAustralia

2020-11-12 22:24:25,Daily tasks via Flow,"Hi!  


I'm working in a team where we have tasks that must be completed everyday. Today we have Flow posting a message everyday(triggers when an event in outlook calendar pops) with a list of all tasks that must be done. Then the users reply to that message with what task they will do.   


Unfortunately this isn't working all that great for us and we would like to visualize in some way to make it more clear which task has been taken and which that hasn't. What I have in mind is a poll of some sort where all the tasks are listed and where users easily can choose a task and mark it as ""taken"". Even better if you can see what user that has taken the task.  


Do you guys have any recommendations, what tools should I use? I'm a novice when it comes to Flow but I'll gladly give it a shot, because what we have now won't work in the long run.  


Another feature that would be great is that if the flow could also post which users that are currently online in the teams channel/chat, or if it could gather data from an xml-file where the names of the members that work that day are written and then post that. So it's easy to spot who hasn't taken a task yet and give them nudge.

Is there a way to manage a unique number of users per channel that is not private.

The ask here is : to have 5 Channels with separate number of Users per channel, some may be in more than one Channel, Privacy is not an importance here, but then have the ability to schedule a 'meet' based on the channel / on its members.

I know this works in general, but any new channels created inherit the same members from the Team.

Having a Private Channel is a work around, but the issue is then having to use the work around in scheduling the meeting, which then does not interact the same way when taking 'meeting notes', and Notes end up with the new meeting and does not link back to the Private Channel.

When calling into a demo IVR I made though and dialing 2122 it doesn't do anything.  If users hover over my name in Teams it just shows my Teams DID with no mention of the extension, even though Azure AD shows the extension.  I have the IVR set to dial by extension in the options and have all users added under dial scope.

When calling the IVR, during the greeting I dial 2122 and it goes silent for 5 seconds and then says ""if you are finished press #"" so if you press # it says ""sorry no one has been found"" or something like that.

Do I need to add the extension in Teams somehow?  If a user clicks Calls in Teams and dials 2122 it says ""we couldn't complete the call, please check the number and try again.""

2020-11-15 01:19:59,Help! Need advice for managing a work team calendar across multiple domains,"Hi all,

I really need some advice. A 50-person regional team consisting of staff from a public agency and contractors from a range of corporate and non-profit backgrounds hastily transitioned to Teams due to the pandemic. People like Teams and want more features but our week-to-week needs are becoming more complex, especially ones that also work for guest users. It is difficult to find solutions because one corporate domain hosts the Team and all others sign in as guests. We don't currently have an IT budget to hire a consultant to help us customize our Teams environment but perhaps if I could sketch out a specific ask and understand how much it would cost to reduce our cross-domain issues then a budget could be allocated in the future. 

I have two sets of questions:

1. Is there any way I can set up a group calendar that everyone can submit to and import into their personal Outlook, iCal, or Gmail calendars, including guests? 
2. Is there any way to make guest users into full users without granting them access to everything else associated with my corporate domain?

I have an MS Live account, which I have from signing up for Skype. This account is based on my email address @gmx.com .

Ask your admin to get you started with Teams, or set up another org in Teams using a different email address.
""

If by ""your organisation"" , they mean gmx.com , well, that's no surprise, since gmx.com is a provider of webmail, and there will be gazillions of gmx.com users who might want to use Teams. 

So, does this indicate that, as a private user who wants to use Teams based on an account with a webmail-provider email, I shouldn't use Teams? Or is it some kind of bug?

2020-11-16 09:45:07,Teams filtering out background music all of a sudden?,"My non techno literate mother has been operating an exercise class over Teams for the last few months due to covid lockdowns.

She's been using a virtual mixer called Voicemeeter to combine her wireless mic and locally played music. This mixer creates a virtual mic in Windows that is the one used by Teams.

This setup has worked great and allowed her classes to proceed along with music up until last week where the music started cutting out very frequently and her own voice often as well.

I did my own testing this weekend and noted that the music would start strong for the first 1-3 seconds of the call and then get gradually fainter until it was muted ... all while the mixer indicated it was pumping out plenty of sound.

Totally confused I fired up Audacity and did a recording ... worked perfectly. After a few hours of fiddling with settings, trying alternative apps, etc I [came across this article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/10/19/microsoft-teams-video-app-get-better-background-noise-reduction/3712935001/) stating new AI based noise suppression on the server side was coming in November.

It claims there is an option to change the noise suppression from high to low ... but on a freshly installed Teams I find no such option. Is Teams just no longer going to be a venue for this use case?

I see Zoom has noise suppression but also a 'True Sound' option, but making the move will be a big hassle for my mother and all her class members.",1.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/juy461/teams_filtering_out_background_music_all_of_a/,ProBonerCounsel

2020-11-16 18:50:32,Time taken for Teams Direct Routing policies to take effect,"I have been running Teams Direct Routing with a .\* digitmap and a single PSTN usage for quite a while, and have finally decided it is time to configure it properly like a real phone system so I can do Class of Service for different calls and choose different SBCs etc.

I am finding the topics of PSTN usage, Voice Routes and Voice Routing Policies really hard to research online as the search terms tend to bring up a lot of false positives. The documentation feels a little sparse in this area.

From what I can deduce the built in digit transformation and any transformations I do myself in Teams are applied BEFORE the Voice Routes are evaluated - so my voice routes should always assume E.164 unless I am trying to do internal calling to my SBC to an on-prem system or somesuch.

The issues I am having is that I am trying to make new Voice Routes and PSTN Usages to see what effect they have, but the changes don't seem to take effect immediately - whether I do them with Powershell or in the Admin page.

It did seem like logging out of and back into the client had a effect on how quickly the policies applied - but not reliably.

Can anyone point me in the right direction for how these policies are applied - is there an amount of time they take? Or do they refresh every x? Or is it just black magic?

Also, I would KILL to be able to see which PSTN Usage and Voice Route a call matched to make the outbound call - basically a standard Call Log like I would find in a SIP PBX that would tell me why everything happened - I can't find anything like this at all for teams. Information for days about latency and jitter and IP addresses and versions but I can't find a thing about why a call went where.

2020-11-16 23:55:07,An honest review of Microsoft Teams. You want a summary? IT SUCKS.," Hi.

My name is Andrew Mason. I'm a 10th grade student who knows a bit about computers, and I feel reasonably qualified to make some of the controversial, even downright hostile claims about Teams that I'm going to make.

That said, there may be some instances where my complaints can be easily linked to ""operator error."" If you all have any fixes to these problems, please let me know in the comments below.

I run Windows 10 Home as my OS, and my computer is equipped with a 4-core CPU with a GPU rigged in for good measure. It has 16GB of RAM installed, although 15.7GB is the more realistic RAM capacity. Virtualization is enabled. I use multiple VMs on this system quite regularly.

Now... **time for the app review.**

***Topic 1: General Performance and other technical aspects.***

Microsoft Teams is a chat and meet app directed toward businesses and organizations. Because of it's video and voice chat capabilities, the program is expected to take up a bit more RAM than usual, due to the high-performance nature of voice/video chat applications.

That said, I shouldn't expect the application to take **AN ENTIRE FUCKING GIGABYTE OF RAM** from my memory to run the app WITHOUT BEING IN A FUCKING MEETING!

Let me put it in perspective. I'm a relatively high-capacity technology user. When I'm not in school, I am CONSTANTLY running virtual machines such as Bluestacks and Oracle VM Virtualbox. I turn my video games to the highest graphics settings possible, and I can do that, because the GPU embedded in my PC handles most of it, and even though the thermals are less than optimal, the PC rarely overheats.

My computer EASILY handles all of these programs going at once. ALL OF THEM. It's never a problem. I can run a high-power-usage game on Bluestacks while downloading 3,654 image files to a backup drive while installing Windows 10 Professional on a Virtual Machine and the computer does perfectly fine.

PERFECTLY.

FINE.

Now, enter Microsoft Teams. The new, shiny chat app for businesses that is supposed to leave all of the other applications in the dust. That one application that is able to **SINGLE-HANDEDLY FREEZE MY ENTIRE DISPLAY FOR 10 MINUTES** WITHOUT ANY OTHER APPLICATIONS OPEN.

Seriously, Microsoft. SERIOUSLY. I have to use this piece of shit for my school and I can't do ANY other shit without it breaking the computer. What the fuck? My computer can handle 3 different VMs at once, but THIS app is the one that breaks it? THIS APP? This app that minimizes for no apparent reason, then just **SITS** there in my toolbar, **GUZZLING** RAM while I desperately try to open Task Manager so I can just kill the damn thing?

Fuck that. You're going to have to do better than this, Microsoft.

***Topic 2: In-App Characteristics and Performance Habits.***

Microsoft Teams has many features excusive to the app that are supposed to improve the experience of the user. I say ""improve"" using the *loosest* sense of the word. Really, these things just impede on the productivity of the user's time.

A clear example of this is the notification system, which requires the application to run in the background to open notifications, which, just as a side note, are **THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN ON MY DISPLAY.** (More on these later.) However, the ""background"" Teams uses JUST as much RAM as the active Teams, meaning I can close it, open all of my applications, and then freeze my fucking computer because I forgot that that little background parasite is sapping my memory.

Yes, I understand that there are options in the settings menu to turn this feature off, and no, I'm not changing my mind. They should have that shit turned off by default, it's so terrible.

Now, back to the notifications.

Microsoft Teams uses solid brick notifications that are completely separate from the actual OS notifications. They pop up about once every 20 seconds, depending on your organization or how many teams you are involved in. And the shit part? THEY DON'T GO AWAY. If you're busy watching a video or writing a paper, these will just STACK AND STACK and the OS can't do **SHIT** about it. You have to go through and manually dismiss them using a cryptic, hidden little ""X"" icon, and if you miss it in the slightest, what do you know, the Teams application pops up in your face and proceeds to navigate to the place where you were, giving you a little turning bubble sign showing that it's ""loading the team.""

Again. There are options to turn these off in the Settings. I think they should be turned off by default.

**And now.... the actual meetings.**

They suck.

They fucking suck.

Video and audio quality immediately go down the tubes. Forget trying to look pretty on camera. You'll just be about 8 pixels on a tiny little display that, half of the time, no one can see, which brings me to another ""feature"" that Microsoft so graciously implemented in the application.

There are 3 different ways to see your Microsoft Teams meeting: Gallery View, Large Gallery View, and Together Mode. I'm not going to mention Together Mode again. It frankly shouldn't exist.

Gallery View is the default viewpoint, and at first glance it looks fine. It shows a couple videos, and shows the little non-video icons when someone is speaking, and looks nice, with a bunch of little layouts that give a kind of aesthetic, minimalist feel to the meeting.

EXCEPT IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK. I don't know what kind of algorithm they use that determines who is shown and who is not, but it sucks. People who have their cameras on are rarely seen. To be seen, the viewers have to turn their views to Large Gallery View. I can't tell you how many times that my teacher has literally been SCREAMING at us because she couldn't see ANYONE's cameras, and I had TO fucking WALK HER THROUGH the steps on how to enter Large Gallery View so that she could see that almost EVERYONE HAD THEIR CAMERAS ON.

This seems like something that could be easily fixed! If a certain amount of people have their video on, the display automatically switches to Large Gallery View! I could fucking code that, and I barely know how to code! Someone hire me for this goddamn bullshit.

(I'm kidding. I doubt I could understand the programming language that Teams uses. But it does seem reasonably easy to code in.)

Anyway.

The app runs like shit.

***Topic 3: Misleading and Exploiting.***

Recently, the public school system I attend banned the use of Zoom for school meetings. It was something along the lines of poor security (although it's basically the best security a video chat application has to offer). Microsoft Teams was the alternate solution, and here's why it was Teams, and not LITERALLY ANY OTHER APPLICATION EVER.

Teams runs like shit, but it masks that issue with the sheer level of shiny new features it has that are supposed to ""improve the security and the experience of the application."" This led our school administration to believe that Teams was the optimal decision for a chat application that the school could use.

Now, I'm not shitting on our school system. I'm sure the administration put quite a bit of time and effort into selecting an application that they believed would help the productivity of Distance Learning and related activities. But I am saying that they were probably pulled in by the misleading I just described, and they fucked up. They fucked up bad.

None of the features in the application make the app any more secure, because they all rely on the competency of the people managing the meetings, which, in some cases, is nil. Therefore, it should come as no surprise when some RANDOM person is let into the meeting, and then starts spamming the chat, playing loud shitty music, and distracting the entire class. Zoom could be just as secure as the administration wants it to be if the teachers knew how to use it, but no, they decided Zoom was at fault, and not the teacher's incompetence.

Again, I'm not trying to shit on the teachers too much. I understand they're doing the best they can to adjust, and especially for people of their age (most of them are Gen X or older) learning how to use technology can be challenging. But it's even more challenging when the school system suddenly SWITCHES the application to a new, harder-to-use THING that runs like SHIT and is so fucking cryptic you can barely find the settings.

This is the kind of bullshit that the school system, the teachers, and the students fear in a chat application, and Teams has quite possibly achieved pure dominance over that realm. It is, ALMOST LITERALLY, just one big steaming pile of shit stuffed into the computer's storage.

Anyways.

I'm done with my rant. My conclusion? Don't use Teams. Use Zoom. Or Discord. Or Google Meet. Or literally anything else.

Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.

If this has been answered I apologize.  I did a quick search but didn’t see anything.

Recently, my company has started granting Teams licenses to those that require it.  We are not planning on switching from Cisco Jabber to Teams as our default Chat application. With that said, the people that have Teams installed on their PCs are having an issue where Teams keeps setting itself as the default chat app for Office.  They uncheck the checkbox to ensure it doesn’t register but everyday Teams sets itself back as the default.  I found a registry key that I can change to set it back to Cisco Jabber, but Teams overwrites it when it starts.  

Any ideas on how I can ensure Jabber stays the default chat app for those that have Teams installed?

2020-11-19 23:33:46,How to Map a Tag Structure into a Teams Architecture?," Our dataset today might be best served by tags in another platform but we're being pushed into Teams. Currently, we use on-premise file shares for Account Management, Finance, Sales and Technician level data. Inside those, we have a Clients folder where we then \*duplicate\* our client list to allow for Client data to be permissioned out properly.

I could build Teams two ways and no matter what, I feel like I lose.

If I do each clients as a Team, process becomes cumbersome and there are too many Teams with identical permissions.

If I break up Finance, Account Management, Sales and Technician Teams (which on the surface makes more sense), I have to repeat my Clients structure inside each which seems like a poor choice.

Is there some other way to structure data like this using Teams? It's almost like I really want a tagging structure to mark certain forms of data. I just can't see maintaining a clients list in multiple places being indicative of the right solution.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having an issue with images in adaptive cards, these adaptive cards are sent using Power Automate to a user in Microsoft Teams and it waits for the user's response. 

The sending of the card is all good, everything is fine except images. 

The images in my cards are profile pictures of employees in our organisation and I get these images from SharePoint using: 

http://\[organisation\].sharepoint.com/\_layouts/15/userphoto.aspx?size=S&amp;username=\[UPN\]

&amp;#x200B;

This is all good if I put that URL in the browser, I get the employee's profile picture. 

I added this to an image 'element' in an Adaptive Card where the URL of the image is the URL above. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, the image shows if I were to view the Adaptive Card using the browser to access MS Teams.

However if I were to use the Desktop (or Mobile) version of MS Teams, the images do not show.

&amp;#x200B;

I suspect this is related to authentication but is there anything I can do to fix this?

When I was testing this Flow, the images were showing on my Desktop (and Mobile) version of MS Teams, so I feel on the Desktop and Mobile version it's hit and miss... 

&amp;#x200B;

**Any help or insight would be appreciated. Thank you.**

2020-11-21 00:36:15,MS GCC High tenant vs. joining MS commercial meeting,"My organization runs in a GCC High tenant.  Occasionally we need to join a Teams meeting hosted by another organization in a commercial tenant.  When doing so, the native Teams app (which is signed into the GCC high tenant) refuses to join the meeting, and the only solution we've found is to use web browsers to join the meeting. This results in a downgraded user experience for that meeting, and we always have some folks who struggle to join at all.

I couldn't find any discussion about this online.  Is it a known issue that users signed into GCC High tenants cannot join commercial-hosted l Teams meetings in the native app?  Or is this problem specific to our organization?  If the former, are there any known roadmap plans to address this, or ongoing discussions (e.g. uservoice) that I can keep an eye on?

The question is: 

On a shared file (office 365 excel document), the following equation : =IF(C37&lt;&gt;"""",IF(AND(A37&lt;&gt;"""",@CELL(""address"")=ADDRESS(ROW(C37),COLUMN(C37))),NOW(),IF(@CELL(""address"")&lt;&gt;ADDRESS(ROW(C37),COLUMN(C37)),A37,NOW())),"""") - allows for an ""automated"" time stamp- is this time stamp specific for the user, or do others who share the file also see this autofilled/equation? 

at current it seems when person 1 is in the document and the equation work, person 1 is the only person to see it. Is there a way to change this? 

if the answer(s) include using VBA- Office 365 does not support that (currently)- or at least we do not know how to.

If I can't get rid of the old Sharepoint Team Site, can it be disabled so as not to show up and confuse my users when they log into Sharepoint?

2020-11-21 06:18:56,Anyone else frustrated by Teams with seemingly unsolvable login issues?,"I have 2 clients with Teams issues. Let me explain - let me know if you guys notice these issues too:

1. First client is an organization with directory services/email on the Gmail platform. We created Office 365 accounts for everyone but did not want to migrate emails over, retaining the Gsuite stack. I did verify our domain with Office 365 so that everyone can log in to their Office Apps using their domain email address instead of the onmicrosoft.com address. This COMPLETELY breaks Teams. We were not able to get Teams invites and log ins to work reliably at all. I worked with Teams support and engineers, and in the end, they informed me that the Teams system expects AAD on the backend with Exchange for email, but since we are on Gmail for email, the system simply doesn't work. We ended up having to unverify our domain from Office 365 and everyone have to use their onmicrosoft.com address to use Teams.

2. One of my friend/clients have a personal Gmail account with her own domain name. She was added to a company's Office 365 tenet though their Azure Active Directory. Now, there is no way for my friend/client to log in to Teams using her personal email address. When attempting to log in to Teams, she is always prompted to choose Personal or Work account, and although she selects personal (or work) and enter in her correct password, the system gets confused, accepts her password, but then prompts her for a password yet again. This second password prompt does not take any password, so she is unable to log in.

2020-11-24 20:20:28,Only one public Team showing up as a tile,"Hey folks,  


I wonder why there is only one public Team showing up as a tile.  
A deliberated guess would be because it's the only Team with 100 members, all others only have 20 or less members.    
But, as a rather small organisation (350 people), most public Teams will have a limited number of members.  And, if the tiles don't show up, I doubt there will be much growth either.  


Any insight you could share?  Suggestions?  Plugins?  


While at it, it would be nice if -as admin- you could order the teams on the admin page by number of members (sigh).  I'm already developing custom apps for our Moodle application, I could start developing some using the Teams API as well, but it's a bit frustrating to lack basic functions.

We have recently been assigned laptops to work remotely but work out of a Remote Desktop connection but have the choice to open teams within the connection or just on the laptop, my question is what can it realistically track? A few higher ups have said it can track everything to even what your dad had for dinner 2 weeks ago but from what I’ve read on here that doesn’t seem to be the case and I imagine if I open the version outside of the remote connection that it can track even less, is it just idle time and mouse clicks? And if that’s the case is there anyway of it picking up if I used an auto clicker?

I am trying to figure out if it is possible to create a team that can collaborate on several folders that are originally located in another Team/SharePoint, without making duplicates taking up space. Let me try to detail that a little more: I have created a team for some external project partners that needs access to some files, however i dont want them to access all my files so my though was this; What if i create a separate team and copy the relevant folders there? Sounds good, the only problem is that i am left with duplicate files that takes up space. I hoped that when they worked on the files i copied over in the external team, the files would also update in my SharePoint library, unfortunately it is not. Is this not possible to do?

2020-11-27 22:58:43,"MTR, domain joining and new local users","Anyone here with experience on hashing out a MTR system so it predictably works in a domain? Its a really fickle beast in this regard.

Have a couple of very specific niggles which need sorting out. 

1. When the MTR app asks for elevation to access the Settings page, the UAC prompt appears in the background. It should always appear in the foreground.  
Found a workaround, though. Press WinKey five times to get back to the computer login and log in again under the Skype account. Then the UAC prompt can be seen and interacted with. A byproduct of this is that the MTR app is windowed and can't be put back into fullscreen. So, essentially just for accessing the Settings, you are in for a restart later on.  
What makes it even weirder, the other testing MTR works fine. The problematic one is 4.6.23, the other one is 4.6.20. Though I got the same problem previously in 4.6.20 also. They have the same set of GPO-s and are identical machines.
2. Due to policy, to locally administer the MTRs, personalised administrative domain accounts must be used, so using the local Admin account is a no-go. When logging in with an administrative account, the MTR app wants to autolaunch persistently. That means it lauches in a window and can be closed but it soon relaunches.  
Any way to prevent this for any new domain account logging into the MTR ? Modify the Default user profile?",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/k22liv/mtr_domain_joining_and_new_local_users/,sil7z

To add to the confusion, I can't break it on my own computer, but several other administrators here are experiencing this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

* Uninstalled/Deleted/Reinstalled Camera Drivers
* Uninstall Teams/Delete AppData contents
* Installing older version of Teams (this works until the client gets updated)
* Installing the newest version of Teams (1.3.00.32283)
* Run Teams as Administrator

Some additional information:

* No processes are being blocked by our application control software.
* It is not related to one specific camera -- Both internal and external cameras are affected.
* Occasionally, if using an external camera, the user can put the camera into a different USB port and it may work intermittently.
* All machines are on Windows 10 Pro Enterprise 1809 (17763)

2020-12-01 04:12:42,"Camera immediately freezes in Teams, works fine in any other app","Hey guys, I am just about ready to throw Teams out the window(s)

Sadly I have to use it for homeoffice work, so I need to get this beautiful piece of technology working again.

I am using a Canon EOS RP through an Elgato Cam Link.

On Sunday I switched my ASUS X470 Crosshair VII Hero for an ASUS X570-E Gaming. No issues, everything is normal. Reinstalled AMD chipset drivers (although they appear to be the same for both X470 and X570. Used AMDs own driver site as a source, not the ASUS one).

Today I have a Teams meeting and notice that my camera freezes immediately when I join a call or if I go to settings. It's always a frozen image from RIGHT when I opened the setting or activated the camera in the call.

Aside from the Cam Link I have a Microsoft LifeCam Studio connected to my PC.

All cameras work perfectly fine outside of Microsoft Teams. They work fine together in a scene in OBS, they work fine in Microsofts own Camera app, they work perfectly fine in Microsofts own Skype for Business suite, they work in Discord.

So far I have wasted about 5h trying various solutions. I have NO IDEA what else it can be since it works EVERYWHERE else.

1. used  USBTreeView to verify that no high bandwidth devices (cameras) are connected to the same USB root hub.
2. used USBDeview to remove all disconnected devices, then removed all connected devices too
3. uninstalled and reinstalled Teams
4. uninstalled and reinstalled Teams with deleting all Teams folders within AppData
5. checked the integrity of the windows image and installation using DISM and SFC
6. uninstalled and reinstalled every capture device (Cam Link, LifeCam Studio, Elgato 4K60 Pro II)
7. uninstalled and reinstalled capture software (Elgato 4K Capture Utility)
8. uninstalled the OBS Virtual Camera plugin
9. ran Windows update, installed optional updates for Webcam (LifeCam Studio is in the device manager not under cameras but under Imaging Devices
10. removed all NDI plugins from OBS and Windows

Still doesn't help, Elgato Camlink still freezes as soon as I try to use it in Teams and continues to work perfectly fine in all other apps that use a camera. The only time the Cam Link does not work in another app is when it is already in use by Teams (well, frozen in Teams). Then it throws: Windows Camera App error code 0xA00F4243.

We do all we can with workplace controls for Covid but I'd like to encourage employees to at least consider using Teams for personal events (e.g. family birthday video conference). Is Teams not a good choice for this if they just type in email addresses for other contacts? Is it too inconvenient for recipients of an invite who are not currently on Teams? Is there more of an employee concern that our company could monitor / privacy issue? (note I am president and would have no idea how to monitor lol).

I also see Microsoft just announced that you can run a personal microsoft account side-by-side with the work account in Teams. My desktop app doesn't support this yet but I tried it on my mobile app. Is there a reason this would be a better recommendation to our employees? The one thing that surprised me in my brief trial using my personal account is there doesn't appear to be a way to schedule a meeting that family would dial into, you can start a group chat and you can set calendar events for a group but I can't see how you send an invite that will ask all recipients to call in next Friday at 7 for a birthday celebration and then remind them when it is time.

Remote audio recording is not affected; the other participants can hear me in real time.  And, again, not just Teams audio is affected.  If I receive an email notification I will see it minutes before I hear the chime.

Something about Teams isn't playing nice with the remote desktop connection.  Leaving the Teams meeting will cause the audio to sync up instantly as soon as any Teams audio has finished playing (which might be several minutes after I close the app).

So we have just started our journey down the Teams Rooms path after having Zoom Rooms implemented for the past 18 months.

We are looking at the certified hardware list and the prices are really starting to add up.  We already have some high-end cameras and microphones which are actually on the compatible hardware list. But it appears that the vendors don't really offer a certified console without forcing a camera and microphone with it.  We have found one vendor that does a TAP Console with NUC and you can then supply your own camera and microphone, but it is still over the $4000 mark.

Does anyone have any ideas on this?   Also, I am guessing that the certified console is simply the Tap/Touch device?  So all MS Teams Rooms require a touch device no matter what?

I can't remember who invited me or granted my guest access to the org/team. So I'm not sure where to reach out to discuss getting this fixed so I can once again access the org/team.

2020-12-02 16:50:10,Weekly scheduled meeting - how to add one off extra attendee query,"Wonder if anyone can help.

I need to create a weekly scheduled meeting for my department within my organisation. I have been on numerous calls, meetings using Teams but never organised and setup one myself.

I have looked at some official guides and have worked out how I can add the Channel of people (which is everyone within my department) to be on this weekly meeting.

But I can't work out how to I could add people who might come onto an individual meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I create this schedule that all the Channel (my department) meet on every Wednesday at 10 am. But say, I want someone outside my channel (department) but within my organisation to be on the first meeting to welcome everyone or on week five, a head of another department to be on the call for an hour to discuss something.

Would I need to add ALL these people to the list  (adding them in the individual box) when creating this new scheduled weekly meeting for the first time? Or once created I can then modify say the Wednesday meeting on the 9th to have an additional person just for that week.

Having a read on the official website it kind of reads that once created I can't modify it. Or does it means I can't modify the name and description?

'Channels can't be edited or added once the invite is sent. You'll need to send a new invite with the updated channel.'

I don't want to create this new weekly scheduled meeting and then have to cancel it and re-do it if setup incorrectly.

I work in a manufacturing plant and I'm trying to create a link between Lists and Planner for managing equipment failure follow-up action items. The idea is the Lists would contain all of the failure information (Downtime data, equipment information, time/date, etc.) and the follow-on actions would be contained in Planner. 

As the entry in Lists would have to be created first, is there a way to easily link that entry to follow on action items in Planner? Preferably the List entry ID# would automatically be entered into the ""Bucket"" in Planner.

2020-12-03 21:06:01,Question about presenter rights for user group optional attendees,"Hello everybody.

I am an IT technician in a private school. I'm currently trying to create recurring meetings for each classroom. Those meetings will be ""active"" every day for the whole day. I want to add as optional attendees every teacher as well as myself and specify those users as presenters. The students will be able to join the meetings by clicking the meeting link, which will be handled by an already existing school management system we have created.

I have created a user group in the Microsoft admin center called Teachers. I can successfully add those teachers as optional attendees, using the name of the user group. However, in the meeting options, I can't specify that group to be a presenter, neither as a group nor as specific users. It's as like those users are not attending the meeting.

The idea is to create virtual generic classrooms, that the teachers and students will be able to freely join, given certain policies. I want every teacher to be able to join every meeting and to have presenter rights. The student will be able to join any meeting as long as they are a member of our organization, but they won't have presenter rights, except if they are given explicitly by the teacher during the lesson.

Is there a way to do what I'm looking for? Should I try looking for another solution?

2020-12-05 05:51:53,Setting up Dynamic Emergency Calling with Calling Plan Users and a Multi Company Domain,"Hey Everyone,

We are at the last few steps of fully moving over to teams as our VOIP solution, phone numbers assigned, AA and queues set up but we cant go live without the proper Dynamic Emergency calling setup. Sorry about the long post but since it needs quite a bit of context and some reasearch was done, I sort of need to make it as detailed as I can. 

Here's our current scenario:

* We are in a Multi Company (in our parent company's) tenant, so anything we have to modify has to be done in a way it doesn't limit anyone else. 
* We have multiple offices all around the world.
* Our users are setup with O365 Voice with and without calling plan (a mix depending on the user) and two extensions. All users with a calling plan has their number/DID assigned to them and that number obviously comes with that user's office's physical location as the Emergency Location.
* Calling in an out works, voice prompt and dual extension lookup from the AA also works.

Here's where the worrying began:

1. Since COVID has more than half of our workforce working from home, a concern was raised if Teams emergency calling could just look up your location like a browser can, for emergency calls. I was just told by Microsoft that location awareness only works in the Smartphone app and even then just to send your current location in chat. Does anyone know a workaround?
2. From what I could find was that calling plan users, when they call 911 (lets just use NA here) - the office location used for the number assignment gets sent. Is that true? I can see the documents telling me thats what needs to happen for emergency calls and I know it should be obvious but Microsoft never makes anything obvious, at least the things you need.
3. I watched a bunch of videos, and it looks like they are telling people to configure a network and if a user is found under a network then the network associated with the site will be the location passed through to emergency services. It sounded good - I mean, at least that's what we had with the old Mitel system. But when I went to configure the networks, I saw no way of associating an IP to an emergency location or external (public) IPs. Anyone know how to get it done? All the videos I've watched or read articles just tells me how to create network sites and IPs and subnets but not how to link them to an emergency location.
4. Since we are in a shared tenant, I can't really use our network subnets since other companies who use it will not be able to use this in teams voice if we do. And I can't use WiFi because 80% of our clients are on ethernet when they are in the office. Switches seems like a bad idea because we have nested switches all over. Any thoughts?

We have calling plan, phone system, etc. It all works fine. I just can't tell how our voicemail is being emailed to us. 

All calls go through an auto attendant and a queue. Call queue's on timeout are redirected to a user - [voicemail@domain.com](mailto:voicemail@domain.com)

So the odd thing is that I can't figure out how that knows to send ""me"" the voicemail based on my call queue. There's nothing setup for forwarding in exchange for that ""voicemail"" user. If I wanted to remove or add someone to get the voicemail for a queue, where would I do that?",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/k8mur9/routing_of_voicemail_im_stumped/,AtariFX

2020-12-08 08:49:15,Organizational structures,"Hi There,

I am trying figure out how to handle my Organizational structures within MS Teams.

I have an accounting firm that has many clients. Services provided are book keeping, payroll, taxes, billing, etc... I am trying to utilize teams as a check off system using tasks (Power Automate). I really have two types of Tasks: 1. Regular, on-going, for example payroll. 2. one off tasks, for example new DBA needs filing. Teams will also be good to have notes/communication that is client specific. We also have client files on SharePoint (currently one SP site, with folders for each client). 

So with MS Teams we have: Teams, Channels. And with Planner: Plans/Lists, Buckets.

My idea,

Team = Client

Channel = Service (Maybe a better way will be just to leave one channel as general and use the plans as below)

Then when it comes to tasking out. I make two plans, on-going &amp; To Do's. (Under each team/Channel). I am not completely sure how the buckets can come into play? It would be nice were I can see a list of all the payrolls (for all clients) that are due that day/week, instead of going to each team(Client).  We only have 4 employees which all of us do all services for all clients.

The only external user solution I would want is that I want to give clients a portal for their documents. Right now I have custom permissions for each folder that allows their email address to access their folder only. All within one sharepoint site. 

Any thoughts or ideas on how to handle all this would be awesome. Thank you for your time!",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/k8tr2e/organizational_structures/,Background-Dinner942

Forgive the format as I am on mobile, but my question is how do I stop my phone (iPhone 12 pro max and I had the same thing happening on my galaxy s10+) from sending me notifications of the meeting I am in? I am a college student and the only reason I have teams on my phone is because I don’t always have access to my laptop and sometimes I need to access meetings/chats on teams and when I don’t have my laptop I’ll use my phone. But what I don’t like is when I’m in class and people are sending messages in the chat I get them on my phone as well but how do I stop that? I don’t need my phone notifying me about the messages when I’m already in the meeting. What I did in the past was go to settings and turn off all notifications for teams but if I do that then I have to go back after the meeting and turn them on but my question is how can I get my phone to stop sending me notifications when I’m in the meeting and I can see them because I’m already in the meeting.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/k9uq3l/notifications/,royalepineapple

2020-12-10 00:55:41,Restrict members from scheduling meetings within certain Teams/Delete meeting info in chats,"Has anyone else had this issue? Any suggestions on a fix/workaround? 

Could I get some votes on this please? [https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general/suggestions/42164251-restrict-members-from-scheduling-meetings-within-c](https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general/suggestions/42164251-restrict-members-from-scheduling-meetings-within-c)

Summary of Issue:

We as Team owners or admins should be able to restrict who can schedule meetings for certain Teams (e.g. a Team containing the entire company of 600+). We can make the calendar read-only for members using PowerShell, but it just errors out for the user and still automatically puts the meeting info message in the Channel, even though said Team is set to only allow Owners to post messages.

Also, these automatic meeting info messages (I don't know what else to call them) that populate when someone schedules a meeting within a Team cannot be deleted, even when our policy is set to allow Owners to delete sent messages. Which means members can then reply to that if they wanted to, even when it's set to only allow Owners to post messages. This causes clutter in channels, especially when the Team contains an entire department of 400+ people.

We as owners or admins should be able to delete these.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, when you try to schedule a recurring meeting in a Private Channel, we get an ""Unable to schedule event. Something went wrong. Edit event to try again."" error. We need this ability especially for large Teams that have Private Channels for smaller subsets of the team.

Example: Team for all employees with private channels for new hire classes that need daily/weekly meetings for training or progress reporting.

I have found a workaround if you use the Meet Now option within the Private Channel, copy the meeting info, then schedule through Outlook, but you have to add the recipients manually, toggle between two systems, and users could join the meeting at any time (even hours or days prior).",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/k9w8l3/add_ability_to_schedule_recurring_meetings_in/,mediumrarest

A client of ours is moving offices and we are building it out. We ordered the new Polycom Teams Phones (CCX400) and one conference phone (not sure model). 

We've had plenty experience setting up user desk phones, but I'm curious how we setup the conference phone in the easiest manner possible. I was thinking the following:

- Setup a dummy user in 365, e.g conference@domain.com
- Provision dummy user a voice number license and assign.
- Log-in to dummy user on the device.

We had about 10 channels set up in Slack for various topics (eg. Sales) or projects. We used those channels completely unthreaded.

Now we've moved to Teams and I've added the same channels to Teams. However, because of the threaded nature of conversations in Teams channels, it seems like people are missing parts of conversations and feel like they have to search for what they've missed rather than just noticing that there is conversation they have to get caught up on for any particular subject (eg. Sales or a particular project).

How are Teams channels supposed to be set up? I am I using them incorrectly by trying to duplicate our Slack setup?

Is there a way to turn threaded conversations off in Teams channels and just use a single unthreaded conversation?

Should we use group chats instead? If we do, is there any way to have multiple group chats with the same participants? (I don't think so.) Because named group chats could work just like our Slack channels did.

2020-12-14 22:35:18,Lenovo 500 MTR virtual keyboard issue,"Hi All,

Looking to reddit for a last ditch effort as Lenovo/MS have been little to no help...

  

The screen appears to be “freezing” but in fact the virtual keyboard is popping up behind the Teams kiosk. We know the screen isn’t freezing as we can press the Windows key using an external keyboard, which brings us to the Windows side of the unit. The touchscreen and system is working correctly.

Senior Lenovo engineers have informed us that the issue seemed to be resolved by an OS Update in May 2020  [https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4550945/windows-10-update-kb4550945](https://clicktime.symantec.com/3AjjAUz6c7U9ukoiaHGAAym6H2?u=https%3A%2F%2Feur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fclicktime.symantec.com%252F3P65vovujoAgkGRRtsszEx46H2%253Fu%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Feur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com%25252F%25253Furl%25253Dhttps%2525253A%2525252F%2525252Fsupport.microsoft.com%2525252Fen-in%2525252Fhelp%2525252F4550945%2525252Fwindows-10-update-kb4550945%252526data%25253D04%2525257C01%2525257CKumar.Sunil%25252540landg.com%2525257C30fc3ddbddcb4524d34808d89daeb970%2525257Cd246baabcc004ed2bc4ef8a46cbc590d%2525257C0%2525257C0%2525257C637432721119529727%2525257CUnknown%2525257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%2525253D%2525257C1000%252526sdata%25253Da7JbF1mhdXVtCCBINcI7NPT1SJaTmXRDVDliIXotD80%2525253D%252526reserved%25253D0%26data%3D04%257C01%257CKumar.Sunil%2540landg.com%257Ccc9aad441cdf4b7cf48e08d89dc2c63d%257Cd246baabcc004ed2bc4ef8a46cbc590d%257C0%257C0%257C637432807164472264%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%253D%257C1000%26sdata%3DpcGk12V04NId%252FIOpFc6PAVByPPwH8HoMO6Glo7B6Htc%253D%26reserved%3D0). 

This was an update to correct how the OS interacts with the Teams Room App &amp; VM.

This is still an issue across a small percentage of MS Teams Room devices across all the OEMs

MSFT is investigating - however *KB4550945* for now is the core resolution to the issue.

It appears to us that the Virtual Keyboard is getting stuck behind the Teams Room App – you can see the Human Interface Detection – HID working when you press on the device but the VK does not come to the foreground of the app and certainly works when invoking the VK on the Windows Admin side of the device. 

The manual work around is:  

&amp;#x200B;

* We find the way to RE-Activate the Virtual Keyboard it when this happens is to press “Cancel” - if it doesn’t show up OR click on Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and press on the Invite area and hit cancel – this may not always resolve the issue

&amp;#x200B;

* Lastly is to restart the device  

The Virtual Keyboard Issue is one that been an problematic across manufacturers on the MTR’s since inception HOWEVER – it has predominately been resolved by KB4550945.

In the small percentage of devices where it still occurs – we presume that is a “left over” that cannot be over written and our guidance is to Re-Image and update via best practice.

This however is not an Lenovo hardware issue AND MSFT likely will not be issuing an upcoming update to resolve the small percentage of issues at this time. The complete resolution will likely be when Teams Rooms will be compatible with OS 2004 in 2021.

I understand that re-imaging isn’t a guaranteed success, so I’ve re-escalated this with Lenovo &amp; Microsoft to try and gain a better understanding on what’s going on.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any other insight, or experienced this themselves?

&amp;#x200B;

Noticed a weird issue where I can't hear anyone for about 5-10 seconds throughout my call. Happens every few minutes. I think it's just me because no one says, ""Oh, I missed that. You cut off. Can you repeat yourself?""

I think it might be my Wi-Fi. I recently moved apartments and had to switch to Spectrum. I did an internet test, and my internet is ""very fast"" (around 193 mbps download and around 10 mbps upload). I'm not sure if there are certain settings I need to fix in my router/internet settings to prevent this?

I also have a work phone that I never connected to my Wi-Fi. It doesn't have this issue when I call in from Teams on that phone.

Any idea what could be the issue? Tried looking at other threads/Googling, but nothing helped (all the responses I saw were directed towards laptop issues).

2020-12-15 20:46:36,Fix For Lack of Features like New Meeting Experience,"Hi everyone,

We've been trying to troubleshoot the fact that most of our users are on updates versions of MS Teams, but do not have the option to enable the new meeting experience, or some other features, like the custom backgrounds.

Uninstalling Teams and reinstalling does not fix the issue, neither does upgrading to the latest version.  We have people on [the Dec 1 release](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/i4wv6r/thread_for_reporting_new_versions_of_teams_desktop/) and they do not have the new meeting experience.

**We've been able to figure out that this is related to something in the person's appdata folder.** 

Overwriting the %appdata%\\teams and %appdata%\\microsoft\\teams folders with the folders from someone who has the new meeting experience fixes it, however, that is not a way to fix it for our 1500+ users.

Does anyone know what is causing these weird incongruities, or have a way to fix this permanently that they've come across?

There are some undesirable side effects of copying a users appdata folder to another machine, and we do not really want to do that for 1500+ people.

2020-12-16 00:39:25,Should Teams expand past the Teams App?,"With Salesforce purchasing Slack and Microsoft rumored to be bringing Dynamics into Teams it got me thinking about the idea of Microsoft adding ""Teams Support"" into various Office 365 functions.

Example:

* Inside of Office apps such as Word or Excel, the chat system should just be a Teams based system.  When you want to notify someone or have a chat in a document, it should just be part of the Teams system and not require you to go into the Teams app.
* In Outlook you could IM someone quickly from their contact via a quick chat pop up window.
* If you want to call someone just click on a number and use Teams to make the call
* Allow third parties to have the chat and messaging system integrate with their clients or software.

All of this communication would still sync back to the main Teams app, but allow for Teams to be the foundational communication platform across O365.

Anyway, just an idea to help orgs get away from so much email, and allow for quicker communications and status updates.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/kdp366/should_teams_expand_past_the_teams_app/,OpeningFeed

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone,

I did research on this issue and there does not seem to be a solution.  
we have some users with 4000 Contacts that not sync to Teams.  
we migrated users from skype for business to Teams.  


I found two solutions that worked for me:  
**option 1 -**  


**Set-CsUserServicesPolicy -Identity global -UcsAllowed $False**  
Rollback the UCS policy by using **Invoke-CsUcsRollback -Identity “user”** if you do not roll back the user from UCS the contacts will not be removed from the contact store. If you do not change the policy and you run the rollback after 7 days the contacts will revert back to UCS.  


after we tried this option.  
after a week the Contacts appeared on Teams.  


**option 2 -**  
after we moved the users from skype to Teams only.  
we see a few contacts. (10 contacts out of 1000).  
we remove the 10 contacts.  
after few days the contacts appeared on the Teams Clients.  


After we opened a case in Microsoft support two months ago they said there was a bug and they are working to resolve the issue.  
and they said the issue solved.  
so far the isuee still happend.  


Of course, there is the **export/import** solution but it is a solution we prefer less.

Has anyone else used the Poly CCX500s in a real environment?

We're having so many issues logging users into these, updating, calling without a weird delay etc. (this is updated to the latest firmware version)

A few of the many log in errors:

\- Logs into Teams, then immediately goes to an InTune 'device compliance' page. Says the device is compliant, lists the name. You can't progress past this.

\- Gets stuck on 'Verifying your settings' after logging into Teams

\- Try to log in to Teams, says  'something went wrong, let's try again'

\- Users who are already signed in by way of miracle and prayer randomly get 'Your dial pad is unavailable'

I'm also getting 'software update failed' if I try to update the phones from the Teams admin centre. It just times out. If I update directly from the Polycom web console it works.

I am absolutely baffled as to how hard this is. Not to mention issues when I finally, miraculously can login to the phone - calling external users results in a delay on their end, so they often hang up before it connects properly, sometimes you pick up a call and it doesn't connect (if they ring back, connects fine) etc etc.

These things aren't cheap, and Poly have been no help. It is the worst experience with a device/software suite I've had in my decade plus in IT. The errors aren't consistent nor are they informative.

Yes, yes - use headsets, I know - but you still need common area phones.

2020-12-17 17:16:59,cannot sign in to Polycom VVX - Teams,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

We have a problem with some customers that used Polycom VVX.

when we tried to connect to Teams (Teams only) by **web sign in**.

**we get this Error - Skype for business authentication failed. sign in again.**

\*the user without MFA.

it seems like something changed on the gateway of Microsoft.

 

Any suggestions?

2020-12-17 17:59:03,Teams phone calls with desk phone - how to set out-of-office auto-answer message for whole organisation?,"Sorry, this query might be a bit involved...  
I'm new to a small company, as is the Teams phone system, so nobody there can help me with this (8 employees varying between remote and in-office).  Tomorrow is our last day in the office before we close for a three-week Christmas-New Year break and it's my job to set the out-of-office messages on phones and emails. Emails - no prob (Outlook). Phone calls are a very different story and I'm having no luck with googling.   

We currently use Teams for all our incoming calls, with an Android OS desk handset on the reception (my) desk in conjunction with Teams on the PC, and the other users all have Teams with headsets in their offices (or remotely).  The phones are set so that incoming calls to the main number come to reception and a couple of other users, and if a user is busy then the call is handballed down the line to the next available team member.   

Nobody knows how to set the phones to an auto-answer message along the lines of ""Thank you for calling organisation, we are currently closed and our office will reopen on X date"" and give the caller an option to leave a voicemail if required.  

Is it possible in Teams to set the whole organisation to divert to one message that will then let callers hear an out-of-office message with the option of leaving a voicemail, or does every user have to set themselves as out-of-office individually? If the company can be set to one OOO message can anyone tell me how to set this, and if I can record the message or it will only give pre-recorded options? Googling has not been helpful in finding this info.  

Thanks in anticipation.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/keuoh9/teams_phone_calls_with_desk_phone_how_to_set/,veedubbug68

usaly our CEO plans a yearly meeting via our on prem skype for business infrastructure. This does not really work well. I suggest him to to do this via teams, so all users are better connected to MS server then to our on prem infrastructure (most users are in home office).

Connection to this meeting was fine, but some users did not see the presentation. Some used the teams client, some browser (mostly chrome). That was not a positive point for our teams adoption, so i like to fix this issue.

I thought there were a analytics dashboard for meetings like for calls, so i could see what happen, but i did not find that.

On the microsoft awsners forum you see quite lot complains about that, but no solutions. So i like to ask the reddit community if there were something that i can look for. 

The test meetings was with about 80 ppl. The real one should be with 220. I know a live meeting should be better, but we did not have experiences with that.

2020-12-17 21:53:39,How to use presenter view for PowerPoint in Teams on Mac,"Hi! I have too low IQ to find out if this subject has been solved or not on this message board. The tread (6 mo old) I found on the subject became locked 3 mo ago without a solution that worked for me. Please delete this post if I violate any guidelines or such by posting this.  


In order to use presenter view when presenting a Microsoft PowerPoint file in Microsoft Teams on a Macbook, you:  
1: Have your presentation open on your computer BUT NOT IN FULLSCREEN.  
2: In PowerPoint, navigate to ""slide show"" tab and chose presenter view. You will now see presenter view which will be in full screen just like it should.  
2: Have the Teams application open BUT NOT IN FULLSCREEN.  
3: Have your Teams meeting window be NOT IN FULLSCREEN.  
4: In your Teams meeting window, klick ""share content"" and chose your presentation under the heading ""Windows"" (Out of ""Desktop"", ""Window"", ""Powerpoint"" and ""Whiteboard"").  
5: Swipe up with three fingers on the trackpad to display all open windows on your Mac and choose the one whit presenter view open.  


Now the audience should only see your presentation while you see presenter view with your comments and other info. This is of course super easy on a Windows computer but I found that this is the only way to do it on a Mac, and by googling it seems many other have trouble with this too.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/kexu2o/how_to_use_presenter_view_for_powerpoint_in_teams/,juHowbOb087

Not sure how many of you know, but Panasonic has announced that they're going to quit with their telephony solutions. My employer is/was specialised in Panasonic and is now looking for new solutions.

We've been in contact with TendFor and Anywhere365, who deliver contact center solutions with great integration with Teams. The only issue is: the price. Our clients are mainly medium to small businesses that cannot afford such a monthly fee. 

Which is why I'm here. I'm looking for a solution that integrates with Teams (obviously!) and can support at least the following functions:

* Call queues
* Voicemail options
* Forward phone calls
* Play prerecorded messages (the ""Welcome to Contoso, a representative will be with you shortly!"" kind of voice recording)

I'd love to hear your suggestions! We're looking for a proper but economical solution.

Thank you all in advance!",1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/kez3qe/voip_solutions_ms_teams/,JK_MezenbergTechniek

So my organization has Teams on the mobile phone app as well, which is new to me. On my phone, I have *NOT* given permission to Teams to access the iPhone Camera in the settings (only the microphone). I have been holding Teams calls just like I would with a regular phone call. 

This week I used my phone to answer several Teams calls from a colleague who for some reason calls using Teams Video — I can see in my iPhone call log “Name X - Teams Video”.

When I pick up these calls, I just drag the button to answer and didn’t notice anything until today.  During one such call I looked down and noticed there was no line crossing out the video camera in the bottom left (even though there’s no camera permission).

Now I’m wondering if I accidentally had video calls even without the iPhone Camera permission to Teams? I would’ve looked not great with awkward angles, messy background, etc. :(

My company(~100 users) is looking at moving away from using WebEx, and teams look like it may serve us well.

We would need the ability for phone line dial in to conferences. From what I understand, this is a simple license add-on(+$4) to our office 365 business standard license(currently $15 user/month).

Also, I'm aware that there is currently a 1 year free trial upgrade we can use. Most likely will be doing that.

I state that info to try and verify I'm not working off some bad assumptions here.

A couple things I have had trouble in answering:
The teams specifications page lists that you can only use 20 call in users for a web conference meeting, does this extend to call-in users when you have the add-on?

I don't believe all 100 of our users will need phone conferencing, half of that is probably overkill even, but our need has grown so quickly over this pandemic, I would not be surprised if in a year from now, it would be a common need for every user.
So when using the addon 1 year trial, I would probably want to add it for every account, and then pull back what we don't need at the end, is that as streamlined as other windows licensing? Basically we have not had to purchase license addons and I'm not sure how permanent of an upgrade it is to the license.

Team A and B have a Planner app with a lot of content, they also have a lot of chat history.

Any feedback or similar requests?  We are hoping there is a way to default a meeting to Large Gallery  vs. it being a personal setting for each user.  

The biggest challenge we have with Teams vs. Zoom right now is folks default to the Zoom for larger meetings because of how it seamlessly handles the meeting growing (people join, their video is just auto there)... simple...

In teams, an end user would have to go in and manually change from gallery to large gallery... thus creating a non-intuitive experience.

My main reason for pushing Discord was I've got several years of experience with it and really like how it handles group chat, voice chat, screen sharing, and server rooms ... but if it's not a good fit for a newsroom, how is Microsoft Teams better than Discord?

To clarify, I'm coming from the understanding that Microsoft Teams is kind of like Discord but more professional somehow and it's more expensive (kind of like Slack I guess, but while I have at least tried Slack once, I've never used Teams and don't know where I'd go to try it). The cost barrier and the fact that I've had no reason to use it have limited my experience with Teams so I'm not sure where to go to get up to speed.

2020-12-31 08:44:39,Teams Voice not ready for our small office,"I really wanted Teams Voice to work out for us.  We are a small dental office and we use ms365 for as much as we can (Outlook, Office Online, SharePoint, Teams).  We aren't huge consumers of any of these, but being able to have access for little cost is awesome.

We want to replace our cloud PBX (sip based) with something WebRTC based like Teams Voice, but 2 key voicemail features are just missing for us:  
1.  Send directly to voicemail.  There are times like after hours or during lunch that we need to send non-urgent calls directly to voicemail.  Our cloud PBX can do that with a button on the phone.  


2.  Truly shared voicemail.  Again for non-urgent calls, we want to be able to check on those messages.  While we can set up a Teams group, checking the messages is not intuitive: you have to go through the Outlook app instead of the Teams app which is just silly and our physical phone does not indicate any voicemail.  
If we hack the setup and forward the voicemail to everyone then we get voicemail notifications in Teams but have to ask each other if the request has already been handled.  


The other parts work pretty darn well, and urgent calls are handled perfectly for the doctor (teams app), except again for straight-to-voicemail.  People calling at 3 am don't want to wait through 20seconds or ringing, and the doctor isn't going to pick up at that time anyway.

Transcribing voicemails is also fast and accurate which we love, and returning calls using the office number is easy (we can ditch our DISA).

I recently purchased a Shure SM58 and a Scarlett Solo that sounds excellent in the Windows 10 Audio Recorder, Discord, and Audacity. However, when doing a Teams Echo Test it seems that the microphone quality is being compressed down to sound like a very cheap clip-on mic. I sound muffled and my colleagues are telling me they can barely hear me at all.

Has anyone managed to get their microphone working correctly with a similar setup?

I have done some quick research on this and have noticed other folks are having issues as well:

2021-01-06 23:25:08,An obvious problem in an intranet embedded in App Studio,"Hi, maybe some of you have configured any app in the App Studio editor of Microsoft Teams.

The problem i have faced doing this is that my app is an embedded internet site, so when someone uses that app, in some time it will be redirected outside of the Teams app if some external link is clicked.  
For example, i have a customer who has users that download their internal company documentation (HR o salary docs for example) from an intranet site, but the users reach to that site from the main site which is embedded in the Teams app (i mean, the landing page of their intranet). And when the user reaches to that part of the intranet where they want to download the documentation, Teams is no longer necessary for that operation, which in this scenario it's not a making a good adoption incentive.

Please consider that the intranet site it's not a SharePoint site. And maybe this will be the main problem...

The question is... What would you propose to do in that scenario if some of you had or have in the future to deploy an app for this purpose.

One of the things that annoy me, personally, the most about Teams Live Events is that you cannot have custom layouts of multiple presenters! My company already has a vMix License, so naturally, the third-party solutions that Microsoft only allow (Hive, Kollective &amp; Riverbed) aren't really feasible.

I came up with a clever way to get around this (which you can see in full detail via [this link](https://we.tl/t-yY5MqiTypA), only available until which Jan 13th 2021) using the NDI ([https://www.ndi.tv/](https://www.ndi.tv/)) feature in Teams meetings, editing it inside of vMix and outputting it into the Teams Live Event call.

**The problem is**, when I add in the vMix output as a virtual camera, I'm unable to switch to my camera in the Live Event. Wondering if anyone has come had problems in Live Events with virtual cameras themselves (I understand it's a specific use case) and if so is there a fix?!",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/krt7we/virtual_camera_during_a_teams_live_event/,CaptainIreland41

I used to be able to turn them off in the settings for notifications and that fixed it. Teams LOVES wiping those settings whenever it gets the chance though to make sure I get more pop ups placed right in the text box I'm typing in (also a totally great feature btw, love getting my view obstructed needlessly). 

Now I'm at the point where I'm literally banging my fist on my desk in pure frustration because no matter what I do, the notifications are just staying switched on now. I literally have them ALL switched off or just relegated to the feed only and yet I'm still getting bannet pop ups for every chat, mention, etc. I've tried force closing Teams with the task manager, resetting my computer, etc. No idea where else to turn. I can't reiterate how aggravating this stupid program has made my work day. Why the hell are there even notification settings if they aren't even able to be turned off?

Today I only had my bluetooth headset connected, which can be used in two modes: stereo or handsfree. The problem is that handsfree mode has no volume control and is really loud, and the usage of handsfree mode prohibits the headset from playing audio properly in audio mode. 

So because Teams FORCES you to pick any option for the microphone (in this case the only option being handsfree) it renders my headset utterly useless because now I either blow out my eardrums or am deaf. Is there no way to tell it to just not pick any microphone? 

Since I was only intending to keep it muted that would solve the problem in this use case.

My colleagues and I are would like to create breakout rooms during our meetings with our tutoring groups. These meetings take place in a private channel. Only teachers and students from a certain group have access. When we try to create breakout rooms from an online meeting in this private channel, we get an error. Is this a known issue? Couldn't find it online. Creating breakout rooms on other channels works fine.

Workaround is to place the online meetings in one of the other channels, but it would be nice to hold the entire meeting (including the breakout rooms) within the private channel.

I don't have a camera or mic on my computer, so I used to enter meetings by joining on my desktop and then separately calling in to the meeting on my cell phone for audio.  This week I started using the feature (I think it is new because I never saw it before 2021) where when I join the meeting on my desktop it asks if I want it to call me for audio (instead of me having to call in).  I say yes, and it calls my cell phone.

This works great, except that I discovered in a meeting today that I am audible even when I mute the audio on my cell phone (by pressing mute on my phone, not through Teams).  When I do it the ""old"" way (call in to Teams instead of Teams calling me) I can mute myself in the meeting my muting my cell phone.  This seems very strange to me, since I would think that muting my cell would prevent all audio from going through, but it doesn't.  This doesn't seem to be an issue with my cell phone, since I am correctly muted when I call in to Teams instead of Teams calling me, and the mute on my phone also works in regular phone calls.

 So I have a client that uses Google Workspaces as its primary Email provider. They have clients that use MS Teams and would like to be able to have the Teams invites synced to their google calendar and also schedule Teams meeting from google. I understand the complexities and complications as to why this can't work. Just wanted to see if there is an option out there to accomplish the following without messing with the mxrecords.

1. We can setup a microsoft account, not a problem.

2. We do not want to move the mx records to the MS tenant.

3. We would like to have Teams invites synced to the google calendar and when scheduling a teams meeting also have that invite show up on the google calendar.

4. We would prefer to do this using the same email address, without having to setup separate email addresses on the MS Tenant.

I would very much appreciate if anyone has any insight or can offer up some direction on the possibilities of attempting this?

So I am the owner of an org (A). I received an invitation to be a guest in a second org (B). Somehow when joining B it asked me to create a password, I found that was strange, I just used the same password. Something wrong happened at that moment which led to a bunch of problems I think.

After joining B, I could still see A in my list of two orgs, but whenever I tried to log into it, it told me I didn't have access and I should contact the owner of A (who happens to be me...).

After much fiddling, I ended up with two different passwords on the same email address! I managed to end up with the following behaviour:

In Chrome and Teams app: I use the one email address, and password 1. I only have access to org B. I tried signing out and using password 2 but it tells me it's not the right password. When signing in successfully with password 1, it won't let me access org A. 

In Microsoft Edge: I managed to sign in with the one email using password 2, where I can see both orgs. I managed to log into org A here but when I try to log as guest in org B, it asks me for a password again and tells me it's wrong if I try to use password 2 again. At this point I'm I'm kind of scared to do anything else in Edge, I don't want to lose access to org A.

My brain is melting. When I go to https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/ it shows me my main alias and the alternate email are the same.

In here, we started to compare the major chat and messaging features but soon realised the entire collaboration experience has to be included.  


David Maldow had already created the video conferencing matrix ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_\_zWyUMQ9SY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__zWyUMQ9SY)) so the purpose of this chart was to add in often overlooked messaging and collaboration complexities faced when evaluating new or additional tools that can appear without IT or procurement sign-off.  


Included:  


🌟 Basic chat and messaging features  
🌟 High-level security detail  
🌟 Notification management  
🌟 Guest access  
🌟 Integrations  
🌟 Messaging interoperability  
🌟 Freemium pricing  


As always, feedback welcomed and I hope it proves useful.

2021-01-11 18:17:00,Looking for ways to create a Workflow in Teams,"Hello everyone! I'm having trouble finding exactly what I need on the internet so I thought maybe someone here could give me a better tip. 

For my work I have a pre-defined Workflow for every new client that we have. It basically involves different E-Mails that need to be sent to the client on a regular basis after they join us. We currently use a specific Software that has this workflow function, where I set up predefined steps **and** how much time should be between each step. 

So, for example, when I start the workflow, the task ""send client welcome email"" appears automatically in my main to-do list. When I mark it as done, it then automatically sets the deadline for the next step (which has already been predefined as ""step 2"" for a week later (or any other period of time I chose). So I always have an overview of which E-Mails I need to send next to each client, and in which step of the overall process each client is. Additionally, if I miss a deadline, the task stays in the to-do list until it's marked as done. 

As we are going to stop working with this other software soon, I was wondering if something like this would be possible with Microsoft Teams. I have tried some things such as the Planner and the Power Automate function, but I couldn't quite set it up the way I would like to....

If anyone had any tips about that I would be extremely grateful :)",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/kuzz6v/looking_for_ways_to_create_a_workflow_in_teams/,almeidab_arthur

2021-01-12 00:04:33,Migrating from Skype for Business: Multiple chat management,"Hi,

Our organisation has been using Skype for Business for many years, since it was MSN basically. I'm used to having a chat window with about 10 active chats on it, jumping between them throughout the day.

&amp;#x200B;

One of things I'm having a little issues with is trying to have these same chats open, whilst using teams for other things (calls, collaborating on a file or using the 'teams' tab to do stuff). The best I can manage is to pop out each chat into a popout window which is a bit less useful than having all my ongoing chats in a window of its own. But if I do this, the toast pop up when a new message arrives will only focus the main teams window not the pop out ones.

&amp;#x200B;

2021-01-12 02:54:14,Creating opt-in only channels within a Team,"Hi there,

In a past life, a company I worked with had hundreds of interest-based opt-in channels.  For example, the San Francisco office had a channel for biking, the Chicago office had a channel for the White Sox, etc.  In other words, a watercooler replacement for remote workers.  I would like to replicate this within teams for my organization, but I would prefer the channels not show up at all (not even a ""*5 hidden channels""* notification.  Rather, I would like to only show them to people interested in those topics.  

I started by attempting to create a private channel, and then sharing the link, hoping it might give them an option to request membership or something like that - no dice.  It basically just takes them to the last private conversation they were having (in the ""Chat"" tab).   

Has anyone found a way to do this, or know if this is even possible?

Any advice for an IT admin who's been tasked with migrating users from Skype for Business to Teams (changing cohabitation mode from Islands mode to Teams only). Company has approx 400 people.

I have changed roughly 10 users from islands mode to teams only on a per user level NOT at a global level, just to test how it works. Everyone I've migrated are having no issues at all, so I am *fairly* tempted just to flip the switch and do it on an global/ organisational level.

* Online repair of Office
* Update Teams client
* Uninstall 32-bit Teams client &amp; install 64-bit Teams client

None of this appears to make any difference. I did find one forum thread on the Microsoft Community from October 2020 but it does not have a resolution. We have first had the issue reported in November 2020, but we don't know if it potentially occured before then.

It feels like it's a bug in the Live Events section. The timing of our issue first occuring &amp; the only forum thread I can find seem to line up quite well, so potentially an update introduced this bug?

We have considered a second AAD, creating a customer only account and then making the event org wide. This doesn't work. After authenticating, the users see a teams loading page followed by another authentication prompt.

I thought this was because the users aren't able to get a Teams exploratory license so I tried a second approach inviting customers as guests. Those guest accounts, however, also don't appear to be able to access the meeting. Policies are set to allow guests and external access.

Has anyone had the same request? Would love to hear suggestions on how I can execute this.

2021-01-13 03:57:42,User cannot view the contents of folders in Files tab,"I had a head scratcher today when a company user asked for help with the a guest who can't view the contents of 2/3 folders in the Files tab. Let's call this team \[2\] BALL. I add myself to team as an owner and investigate. I see the 3 folders (A,B &amp; C) but only have access to C. The other 2 say I don't have access permission with the pic of the ice cream in the ground. I look on the SharePoint of for the team and there's only folder C showing when there should be  A, B &amp; C. WTF. I check all the permissions for that SharePoint site and its good to go. So I remote into the company user's machine to take a look cause she can view all 3 folders. I open them up in teams and they all work fine...it's when I open up the SharePoint for folders A &amp; B that I see a clue. They are linked to another SharePoint site. It's called BALL and his user is a member.

What I think happened was the owner of this BALL SharePoint wanted to create a team but didn't know that could be done after the fact so they just when ahead an created a new team called \[2\] BALL, then migrated the files by drag and dropped the contents into folders A &amp; B. I found the best workaround for this was just to add the guest as a member to BALL and what do you know, they now have access to all the Files in \[2\] BALL.

My question is: how could something like this happen? I was made to understand that if a file lives on a team it also lives on its SharePoint but in his instance that's not the case, it still points to the old SharePoint site. What would be the best way to get all the folders synced properly on to \[2\] BALL?

From poking around on the net, and my own fiddling, it seems to be specifically related to nvidia broadcast populating the MS Teams video source device by default. Unfortunately I have no webcam, so I have nothing else to switch it to and there is no ""none"" option available in the dropdown. I've read that switching it off of nvidia broadcast for video source can solve this problem, but I have no other options.

Does anyone have a solution that doesn't involve uninstalling Broadcast entirely?

2021-01-13 06:10:53,external monitor with teams results in computer locking,"Hi all,

My computer is a dell XPS 15 with a core i9 and nvidia gpu

It's plugged into a 4k external monitor, which is also acting as a power supply (although lower wattage than the proper adapter).

After running MS Teams for ~10 minutes, the windows ""locking"" banner will flash across the screen, then the display will go black. The problem happens whether or not the laptop's lid is closed. The left side of the laptop (I'm not sure if this is the CPU or GPU) is extremely hot (even for a normally hot-running laptop), so I assume this is some kind of thermal throttling problem.

Microsoft teams is the only application that causes this. I can build the linux kernel with 100% cpu usage, or play video games, and never observe an issue.

I never observed this problem before the new year, but now it happens quite reliably. Nothing in my hardware setup has changed. I tried disabling hardware acceleration in teams, but that hasn't changed anything.

Does anyone know what could be causing this, or how to fix it? I have a lot of trouble believing it's an issue with my laptop, considering all other applications seem capable of running at heavy load.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/kw2275/external_monitor_with_teams_results_in_computer/,andrewhepp

2021-01-13 13:26:16,How to really troll on Microsoft Teams(As an attendee) and also if some features are blocked,"1.) You should have teams installed in 2 devices, 2nd one should be a phone only. Now Open meeting on both the devices and mute the one with phone. Turn the volume full on the first one and turn on the mic on second one and place it closer to the speaker of the first one.  
Outcome: The whole class will hear their echo with a screech sound which is very disturbing to hear and tolerate. And ask your friends to turn their mic on too if possible  
2.) In some cases school has blocked the meeting option in your account then what you have to do if  call a friend and then click on the button on top right corner with participants logo and then invite the people you want to talk with.  
3.) You can troll other classes too in your organization. Ask your friend from other section to share their team invite link or team meeting link. Now you can join your friend's class and make everyone presenters and troll everyone.  
4.) And if you are a presenter then you can spotlight a classmate whenever the teacher is screen sharing or has his video on. what this will do is that the rest of the class won't be able to see what the teacher is writing or showing on video.

2021-01-14 10:09:00,Power Automate guru's please!,"Got a bit of a strange one - I need to create a flow that allows a user to create a planner task from a message in a teams channel.

Haha, that's the easy bit. Used one of the templates, tweaked a bit and working fine.

The complicated piece I'm looking for help or advice on is adding 3 options to the task on creation that have a radio button next to each option, and the flow condition is that one of the options **must** be selected before it will submit.

Depending on which option is clicked, the relevant action will happen.

The new task 'card' that gets automatically added to the channel needs to have the 3 options remain on it with the radio button selected showing which option was chosen. So a user can go back through and see the status of each flow card.

The 3 options are, for example:

&gt;Create a new task

&gt;Add content to existing task

&gt;No action required

This is what I use to speak to clients over video chat. I am also working for a client who have an MS teams org and they have created a guest user on their org with my business email address.

I was previously able to be authenticated with both orgs in my windows client and on mobile (Android) and switch between them depending on the most appropriate one.

This week when I was in my clients' MS teams org it asked me to log in again and it would not accept my password. So I went through the forgotten password flow and that seemed to work fine. However, when I switched to my own org MS teams said there had been an error and it restarted the whole client and asked me to choose an org. In the drop down it had my personal one and my clients' one. I chose mine and after about 2 minutes attempting to switch Teams restarted again and this time in the drop down it only had my clients org available.

So now I can only access my clients' teams org via the Windows client. 

I can recreate the problem in the web browser at [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com).

1. I open it in incognito mode.
2. I log in with my personal credentials. 
3. I see a choose org drop down and it shows both my org and my clients'
4. I choose my org, and it opens
5. I then choose my clients' org and it asks me to authenticate.
6. I enter my credentials for my clients' org, and it opens
7. I switch back to my org and it throws an error and brings me back to the choose org selector and only my clients' org is in the drop down.

**Note**: while the web and desktop clients are misbehaving the Android app seems to work fine.

I’m a Film Studies teacher and, as you could probably guess, having students watch films simultaneously is a big part of progression through this course. Since lockdown and the move to remote learning, this has become a lot more difficult.

I assumed, stupidly apparently, that if I rented the film from Amazon and screen shared it that would work, but Teams has blacked out the stream. I’ve tried purchasing it fully, downloading it, streaming on both Teams and Discord, but the film’s blocked.

This is a serious barrier in students learning and there needs to be a way to stream concurrently so everyone has access. The students all have differing financial issues so I can’t ask them to rent or buy the films themselves - especially with the amount that’s upcoming in the year!

2021-01-15 07:28:34,"Get Emoji's and all the extra goodies in Teams, with an external Partner","Hi All

As we all know Teams is awful at IM with Users in other organisations.  But, this was recently fixed-ish.  So if you have a business partner, friend or family member at another Org that you communicate with using Teams, here is what you can do.   I recently had this where I used Teams and my wife used SfB,  IM worked but the experience sucked.  So I found a fix.

Caveat1: This will require O365 Tenant Admin at both ends, but, help desk should be able to do this if you don't have the access.  (I am Admin in both Tenants, so easy to test)

Caveat2: When you are done, BOTH users need to use Teams to get this full experience.

 **Here's what happens**

If one, or the other, of the companies ""Coexistence mode"" is set to ""Islands"" or ""Skype for Business with Collaboration"" mode, then you will continue to use Federation v1, that pushes all traffic through the SfB infrastructure. This results in the shitty Teams experience with external parties that we all know and hate.  We need to use Native Federation  if we want the full Teams experience.  This was only released in November/December 2019. So if you were experiencing any issues before this, then they were by design.

**There are 2 options to get this to work correctly**

1. If you want the full Teams experience including emoji's gif's etc, with an external company, (e.g. wife's company), then you need BOTH organisations to set their O365 Teams Tenant ""Coexistence mode"" to be ""Teams Only"". This allows both companies to use Native Federation (also known as Federation v2). 
2. If is also possible (and I have tested and proven this), to get the same full Teams experience if users are individually set to ""TeamsOnly upgrade mode"", even if the O365 Tenant is not set to ""Teams Only"". 
   1. I did this where 1 Tenant was set to ""Teams Only"" and the other Tenant set to ""Skype for Business with Collaboration"", and the user I tested with set to ""TeamsOnly upgrade mode"".

**HOW TO:**

1. To set the O365 Teams Tenant ""Coexistence mode"" to be ""Teams Only"", you need to be an O365/Teams Admin, and change it here [https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/company-wide-settings/teams-upgrade](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/company-wide-settings/teams-upgrade) . Keep in mind this changes the experience for the whole organisation, so it should be planned and communicated to everyone affected.
2. To set an individual user, you need to be an O365/Teams Admin, and go here [https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/users](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/users)

2021-01-15 07:39:26,"Troubleshooting: Pressing ""Meet"" Does Nothing, and General Lagging of Teams","Okay:

A slew of problems, which occur on MS Teams in browser as well as the app, as well as on other computers. I suspect this is a synchronization problem and am curious if anyone has experienced something similar. Overall, MS Teams seems to lag in strange ways, on a very powerful win. 10 PC.

\- *Sometimes* pressing ""meet"" does nothing. Changing the ""New Meeting Experience"" option in settings simply opens a new tab where pressing meet, again, doesn't work.

\- If it does work, finally, the microphone and video are not able to be turned on/unmuted for what seems several minutes (it says, no available microphone/camera found if hovered over). However, ""Microphone muted"" notice goes up if I make sounds. Keep in mind, while all this is happening, my microphone and camera always work in WebEx.

\- I have already tried using the scheduling meeting options via calendar. I have also tried downloading new drivers, reinstalling, and testing different mics/cameras. I have tried closing all other apps possible from Task Manager just to make sure nothing else is running my camera. I have tried several options posted from googling, I.E., resetting camera and mic privacy in Windows 10 settings. I have also tried working through Windows Powershell.

If I could, I would make a new non-school oriented account to test this theory on synchronization. I have tried to open all the laptops I've used Teams on, watch them re-sync, and log out. I've also re-synced Outlook. Nothing.

i would like to share this idea I had after been asked by a friend in banking, how to create a Teams meeting in which each participant can be verified. After some thought this is what I came up with, and thought i would share.

In short, its leveraging breakout rooms to create a verification and secure room, participants arrive in the ""lobby""  and are moved to verification room for checks, after passing this, they are moved to the secure room.

i think in this way, a generic Teams invite can be sent and all participants processed.

2021-01-16 01:10:05,"Teams freezing when using a virtual webcam that is not actively sending a signal, like Nvidia Broadcast.","Having issues with Microsoft Teams freezing when using Nvidia Broadcast without a physical webcam? (or other virtual webcams)

Here are some ways you can deal with it.

Have not found a solution yet, but have found a temporary workaround.

The problem seems to be that teams freezes while trying to load a (virtual) webcam that does not actually transmit anything. For example the nvidia broadcast webcam when nvidia broadcast does not have an input for the camera.

Now here are five ways to work around this in my personal preferred order:

1: Download obs studio and the virtual camera plugin. Then add an input to obs, i use a random image. Then disable nvidia broadcast, go into teams settings and choose obs virtual camera. Restart nvidia broadcast and you are good to go, but you will have to start obs everytime you want to use teams from now on.

2: Install another noise suppression program, like noise blocker or krisp. Personally i think broadcast has the best quality out of these three though.

3: Plug in a real webcam and select that as your camera in teams, even though you're not going to be using that webcam. Or select this webcam as your input for nvidia camera and keep nvidia camera as your source for teams.

4: Use the web version of teams, though i am not 100% sure that this will work.

5: Uninstall Nvidia Broadcast until this issue is fixed by Microsoft.

Things i have tried, already that do not work:

1 Restrict access to the camera in windows settings, this does not seem to have any effect on Microsoft Teams at all.

2 Reinstall both nvidia broadcast and microsoft teams. (i tried it in both orders i.e. first reinstall nvidia broadcast, then ms Teams and first reinstall teams, then nvidia broadcast)

3 I tried to restrict access to the camera/webcam by editing the group policy, this was completely ignored by teams.

4 I looked through the config files in ms teams, but i could not find anything to disable only the webcam.

5 I tried uninstalling NVidia virtual camera.exe but this made broadcast unresponsive.

6 I tried looking through the broadcast config files if i could disable the virtual camera, but unfortunately i could not find a way to so.

7 I have looked in device manager if i could disable nvidia's virtual camera from there, but unfortunately i was unsuccessful in finding the camera in here.

8 I looked in the registry trying to find a way to disable either nvidia's virtual camera or teams's access to it, but i was unsuccessful in doing this.

How can Teams fix this?

Detect virtual camera's and if they do not output anything, ignore it. Or give us the choice to not use a camera at all, even though teams detects a camera.

Nvidia could also fix this by giving us the option to disable the virtual camera which i would like to have anyway. Actually, rtx voice used to be a stand alone program, but is integrated into nvidia broadcast since some time now.

anyways... good luck.

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.

In this video tutorial, we’ll see how to use Approvals, the app released by Microsoft in #MicrosoftTeams that brings in one single place all your approvals requests.

You’ll see how to install the app to a chat, to a team channel, and as a personal app, moreover, you’ll learn how to create, manage and share an approval request.

Finally, we’ll have a look at more complex scenarios where a custom workflow is needed, using Power Automate to build a SharePoint page approval workflow.

2021-01-18 18:23:50,MTR content view as default,"Hi

With the following conditions met, there is an issue I will explain afterwards.

* MTR 4.7.15 (and older) is in a SfB meeting.
* HDMI ingest is being used (1920x1080 input usually) and shared into the SfB meeting.
* Within MTR's meeting interface, the default view (participants + content) is being used.

The issue is that other meeting participants are seeing the HDMI ingest as a 4:3-like window which has the 16:9 HDMI ingest picture in it and with black bars up and down, making the shared desktop rather small (hence barely readable) in SfB's default meeting view (fit to window).

When the MTR is switched to ""content only"" view, the HDMI ingest fills the whole screen on the singular room display and also the shared desktop is displayed correctly inside the SfB meeting in a 16:9 window with no black bars.

When I use the MTR with two external displays, the meeting view settings no longer matter because the HDMI ingest is displayed on its dedicated display in full size. But this is not a viable solution as I can't equip all MTR rooms with two external displays.

So, in case of singular external display, can I change the default meeting view to ""content only""?",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/kzs2mi/mtr_content_view_as_default/,sil7z

Is there any way around this or is this a limitation of the system?  They don't want an auto attendant greeting but a person to answer during the day.  Which is why I had the auto attendant answer but no greeting.

Is there any way we can block them from doing this without using Information Barriers? The ability for students to chat elsewhere is paramount as we are a university, plus I get the feeling that implenting Scoped Directory Search will have an impact elsewhere in the org...

Then I started reading the limitations of teams, channels, etc...

200 channels in a team including deleted channels, I might be able to make this work.  Anyone else have a work around or use multiple teams doing the same thing?

30 private channels...  Sigh, one of the engineers requested ""I don't want to see things I don't need to"", private channels to the rescue!  Oh, nevermind.  Ideas?

Can't archive channels.  Ugh, so my only way to limit issue #1 is to delete and lose everything.

The usage is dealing with a single vendor on multiple projects so it's hard to divide it down further to help mitigate the 200 limit.

These seem like pretty big limitations, to a point that it is almost not worth using for even a mid sized business.  I'd say we are a small business and really have no use for the ""Teams"" portion of Teams with these limits.  Chat, conferencing, all good though.

2021-01-20 05:49:42,Glitch in my Teams list - hundreds of Teams that I'm not a member of showing up,"Just so you know the audience, I'm an IT admin and am pretty knowledgeable about Teams. We use Microsoft's School Data Sync to sync Team memberships. 

In August, we had a large issue where SDS removed thousands of members from groups. I wrote a script that used the audit logs to reverse those. I don't have a copy of the exact script but it essentially read the log, saw ""user was removed from group by SDS"" and ran ""add user to group"". We then followed it up with [Microsoft's ""Sync group to Team"" scripts.](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-EDU-Tools/tree/master/Teams%20Scripts) 

Since then, I've had a huge list of Teams that I'm not a member of showing up. When I click on one of these Teams, they disappear. I usually only use the desktop client but I've done this using the web client so I can use Devtools to monitor the traffic. When I click on one, it runs the GET for the Team and the response is a 403 - Unauthorized since I'm not actually a member. 

The problem is that since this is such a huge list, it's causing some performance issues. When I click on my Teams blade, it takes a long time to load and uses a lot of resources. 

Over the course of a couple weeks, I spent some time each day clicking on everyone of these Teams until they all were gone. That seemed to fix the issue, until Friday, when I cleared my cache to test forced display name updates (a whole other issue) and they all came back. 

I spent a ton of time staring at devtools and trying to find a fix. In the Application panel, I've found what I think is responsible for the list of Teams, but not how to fix it. In IndexedDB &gt; Skypexspaces-{user object ID} - https://teams.microsoft.com &gt; conversations, I have a list of over 6300 entries and when I clear that table from the DB, I'm left with an empty Teams list in the GUI. 

So it seems that when I click on the Team, it's made not visible or maybe removed from local cache, and stays that way until the local cache is removed. 

I know it's a long shot but hoping someone here might be able to offer some clues so I don't have to reach out to support.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/l0u6lh/glitch_in_my_teams_list_hundreds_of_teams_that_im/,jaydscustom

This semester I've been grouped together with different people, and naturally decided to make another team for us. 

When I click on the ""Join or create team"" link, the only option presented to me is to join a team. I cannot create a team as there's no option to do so. I know of at least 2-3 other classmates who have the same issue, one of whom created 2 whole teams last semester. But for some reason we can't do it anymore this semester.

It's driving me insane and I would happily delete teams for all eternity except that I'm required to use it for work. We all hate it because it acts like this for all of us.

2021-01-22 21:08:59,Bluetooth headset sound cuts out when people join the lobby,"Hi everyone,   
I have an issue that's really bugging me for a while now, so when I stumbled on this sub I got quite hopeful. 

I use a win10 laptop with MS teams application and a bose qc35ii headset. When I am in a call and somebody joins, sometimes they get stuck in a 'lobby' before joining. This means that someone in the call has to admit them in the call. That by itself is not an issue. The issue is that when this happens, teams gives a little 'beep beep' notification, at which point all other sounds from the call cut out for a good 5-10 seconds until it comes back in. You can imagine the annoyance gets quite intense when a few people join after one another during the first minutes of a call.  

I don't have this issue when I am not connected to a bluetooth headset or when I use the web application (I use the web application as well for a client project). I also know from a few other colleagues that experience the same issues. 

Does anybody have any experience with this or similar issues? Any ideas on settings that I could use to solve this problem?

2021-01-22 22:48:13,Teams PC Application Dropping/Freezing Audio and Video. Home Router Settings to Blame?,"Hello Teams enthusiasts.  I am your standard-issue corporate guy working in my home office on a company Dell laptop.  Teams works great for me except for audio and video conferencing.  It's sporadic, but over the last few weeks I sometimes can't answer calls and if I'm on a conference I'll see incoming video freeze and others can't hear me (but it'll return to normal after maybe 5-10 seconds). I'll frequently completely drop off calls and Teams will try to reconnect me.  Our IT team said there's a ""known issue"" and remotely uninstalled and re-installed Teams, but that hasn't helped.  My internet is consistent at 450Mbps download and 25 upload.

This week I answered a Teams call on my iPhone (on my home WiFi network) and had the same issue (no audio) which was a revelation that it's not my PC that's the problem, and that it could be my network, which I overhauled with all new ASUS equipment late last year.  A little searching shows that some router settings could fix this.  Specifically disabling SIP Passthrough and enabling QoS for ""Work from Home,"" which includes video conferencing.

Before I go monkeying around with my router settings (my kid is in the next room on her machine in school so I can't be interrupting the network until later), do you think this might fix my issue?

There is only one thing that I'm missing:

After getting the Live Event running I need to be able to join a normal Teams meeting to get the camera feed from my presenters with NDI. I believe the only way for OBS to see the NDI feed from my presenters is to be in a call/meeting with them. I want to have a style of panel discussion where they are all on the screen at the same time. The thing is that if I'm already with my Live Event open (not started), if I join a Teams meeting I put the event window on hold. If I then go back to the Live Event I get the Teams meeting on hold. How do I manage to produce the event through OBS and at the same time be in a Teams meeting with my presenters to get their NDI camera feed into OBS?

Does Microsoft Teams Personal or “for Home” fall under the consumer side or the regular Teams privacy policy?

I am and have been an O365 admin for multiple tenants and so I know how I can access user data if need be, but I also know that regular support can’t just go in and do whatever they want on corporate accounts. On the other hand, for a product such as Skype, privacy is pretty non-existent, and even if they have fixed the issues with the past, there is no reputation there for privacy of any time anymore.

I’m trying to figure out that if one is using Teams Personal, do Microsoft employees have the same freedom of access that they do for other consumer side accounts, especially with Skype, or does it fall under the general Teams privacy umbrella?

2021-01-25 22:18:46,"This was probably asked 1 year ago now, but Can Teachers see If I am playing a videogame or drawing ?","Alright. **Because I know 10 people will say how I should get education and pay attention to class I'll firstly just give a view to my life, but you should just skip down to another bolded text for a full question**:  

because of huge depression and suicidal thoughts that I constantly have, not to mention just the demotivation to even get a job in future, I left school with a medical paper that I got because of a kidney problem. My dad knows VERY WELL in what mental state I am and that I have some issuess with anger. That is a resoult of Ignoring bullies through  majority of my primary school education.  
In this pause I had, I felt Much happier and I dedicated my time to stuff I like,Digital Drawing, Music making, Japanese language and the least important videogame(WoW) and I have one friend which is enough for me.  
Me and dad talked through this one year and a half exactly about this and we said how we will move out of the country or have homeschooling through some American academy here in Croatia, but few days ago I found out he has been working behind my back, and was since November 2020 plotting how I will return to school in January and how I will have to write all the tests quickly (which is NOT a problem in my case. I can learn enough on my own, I can't concentrate when teachers blabber and force their theories and ways on me. I workin my way and that works for me.). I also have my own views on the whole education system.), but what is the problem is that as I said don't plant to ruin my day by frustrating over teacher talking, and me not being able to get my tablet and draw in programs... Because If I get mad, one annoyed word form teacher for me not giving a correct answer will be enough to make me say something that will get my dad called by phone and CPS contacted.  
I don't mind listening tot eachers, and joining in with microphone. But as long as I get to be free from those ""chains"" of not being able to get a mental distraction that makes me happy.  
I've had a ""nice"" life, to be honest 17 years. except for this last year and a half when I got to have time for myself. CPS is not supportive and thinks that talking to therapists will change they way I feel, even thoit didn't. Antidepressants and antianexity pills just make me sleepy, but don't stop my sadness and only help wiht Seismopohbia I've developed. I see what future holds for me and I don't plan to spend my short life in a place that caused me to mentally break down in the first place. Everyone said that it will be better  with next school, new classmates, new tachers, but those were all lies.  
I could rant more and more but I should just stop, so sorry for a long post. But now that you know why   
I am asking this I hope you can give me an answer and solution if they can see the activity.  
**The question and some info:**  
**1. I don't have original copy of Win 10, if that means anything.**  
**2.I can log in to teams over desktop software I installed ofcourse, ad I've read there is a browsver version.**  
**3. Whichever version I'll use, It will be on my left monitor, aka my alternate monitor, because I have 2 monitors. The left one is for discord and such apps and my main monitor is for Videogames and Drawing softwares and basically main stuff. Why am I mentioning this? because I can pay attention to both monitors and interract at the same time.**  
**4.If they can see my activity and there is no way to bypass it I'll use my spare PC to be connected to teams over that, and use my main PC for my usual activity.**  
**5. I think I've said all neccesarry stuff-no?If no write down and I hope someone answers in a  bit of detail on how can I bypass the activiy checking thing if  they can see it.**

2021-01-28 07:12:56,Need help creating step by step chart in Teams,"Hi all, 

I'll try to explain what I'm visualizing as best as I can. I recently got assigned a project management role for developing 2 clinics (no ""official"" PM experience, just a coordinator experience). 

Up until this point, my projects have been relatively scattered into a series of Visio drawings, personal notes, and a shared drive. I really want to streamline the process and make my life a lot simpler (and less scattered).

My org uses Microsoft Teams. Seems pretty cool. My teams and I operate best with visuals, but I can't seem to figure out how to create a pipeline (we don't have azure) to lay out each step sequentially and who does what...kind of like how Pipefy does it (our org won't let us use external software).

Ex:

\[Step 1 + assignments/due dates\] -&gt; \[step 2 + assignments/due dates\]  -&gt; \[step 3\] -&gt; etc. etc.

Is there a way to integrate this into Microsoft Teams as an accessible Tab in the 'Teams' page without using Azure? Assuming I can create this pipeline for each individual project for these clinics, is there a way to sync the pipeline chart visual with the assigned tasks?

It feels like everyone and their brother makes multiple Team groups and have a lot of subsections. I think many people have a grandiose idea of how they want to use it and have maybe one section that actually gets used. I will get 3 different invites for teams for the same project in different countries for example. Each group will have different subsections and sometimes I miss important stuff. I feel like none of us know how to use it and we are making things worst. I have talked to others in the IT department into having Just one Teams for IT and having small subsections for each logical team like Linux, Winter, Storage, Networking, and etc. Each logical team will only have access to read/write to their subsections. There will also be a general subsection that everyone will have access to. Currently we have east and west coast IT teams, so compressing this into one will help I hope.  Just need to get the PMs to clean up there stuff as well. If anyone has a better suggestion, I am all ears. I have at least 20+ teams and all their subsections and it gets annoying.

However, the strange thing is from the desktop client when they call each other peer to peer their audio and video is muted, they can talk and the person can hear and see them but they can't hear or see the other person. Even more strange is that if I or another user that isn't under this policy calls them they can answer and everything is fine. 

And it then gets even stranger because from a mobile device everything works exactly as I expected it from the beginning, they have to use a phone to dial into meetings but audio and video in peer to peer calls remains totally unaffected.

2021-02-01 11:54:23,Teams for meeting replacement?,"I could really use some help in setting up a team/template for meetings that we have.
A little context:
I work for a company that owns and leases out assets. When a lease ends and the assets are being returned, we have a meeting with people from different groups (sales, logistics, etc) to decide what to do with them (send for maintenance, store, sell, + shipping location depending on decision).  
With the amount of pre-work our team does to prepare for this meeting, 9 times out of 10, the meeting is pointless and we basically just need a decision on the location - think 5-10 minutes, and one group walks away with the task of determining a shipping location.  We do occasionally bypass this meeting but doing so is frowned upon as it's not following process and makes it more difficult to keep the checks and balances in line.
I've been playing with different options and I can't figure out anything that will actually work the way we need it to.
This meeting happens for every lease return we have. It involves roughly the same people every time and the same information is required. I've been trying to set up a template team or channel that we can copy. I made a planner/task list that would work but I can't get it to copy with the team or channel (tried both ways) and it seems like a lot of extra steps to add it/a little confusing for the less tech aavy (only way I can figure is to copy it through the planner webpage. I also tried using ""lists"" but that didn't work right either.

2021-02-01 16:28:13,auto/script upload files to Teams,"Hi everyone,

Our software development department got switched to Teams and we'd like to use the file sync in a special way.

We manage our software with GitHub and branches like this:

project1/dev/V1.0.0

project1/dev/V1.0.1

project2/dev/V1.1.0

We also have a Jenkins server (Linux machine), which picks up any changes, builds the software and places the compiled binary on a network share like this:

\\\\fileserver\\software\\project1\\dev\\V1.0.0\\build\_xyz.zip

Our testing department gets a mail from Jenkins with a changelog on each build, grabs the software from the network share and starts testing.

The problem is, that sometimes our testing engineer is out in the fields without access to the internal network (VPN not allowed).

So if we could upload the software to a teams channel instead this would be really helpful.

I googled a bit but I cannot find a suitable solution. It looks like there is no bot or plugin which could do that. What i've read mounting the sharepoint by webdav only works with some complicated cookies workaround.

2021-02-02 03:09:12,I made a Microsoft Teams companion app,"I recently created [Teamite](https://teamite.sengi.co.za/), a desktop app that sits in your taskbar and lets you view your Teams schedule from anywhere. The app works alongside Teams to help improve your productivity. It's available on Mac and Windows from [https://teamite.sengi.co.za/](https://teamite.sengi.co.za/).

I created the app initially as a fun side project and for my own benefit, but I've decided to try make something of it. I use it every day and it's changed the way I work. I can track when my team is busy, follow Microsoft Project Planner (.mpp) tasks way easier, and I can quickly glance at my schedule without losing track of my work.

My favourite feature lets you create groups to view all of your coworkers' schedules/availability from one place. The teams aren't linked to any actual teams or channels so you have total control of what they're named and who is included. You can also view your detailed event information from this screen so you know what you've got going on at the same time as someone else is free.

[Schedules view](https://preview.redd.it/9a4jsu5buwe61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53bc1937a12e7aefa505c1844e22722e1942b7f6)

You can view your schedule in a *week view* similar to the Teams calendar, but also a more focused *day view,* and a *board view* which shows a stacked list of all of your meetings for the week per day. One of the nicest features is it shows you how much time you have between meetings to get things done (forgive the graphic - I don't want to share confidential information):

[See time between events](https://preview.redd.it/nhjgvhtsvwe61.png?width=890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb4264a048a986bda1139150cf7f623fe83bf780)

The app has a feature to view Microsoft Project Planner .mpp files in a gantt chart, but limit it to only the people you are interested in, and sort it in chronological order for easier task tracking. This has been hugely useful for following work projects with thousands of tasks that I'm not at all involved in.

Please give it a try and I hope you like it :)

2021-02-02 12:17:11,Teams on Mac - Freezing and Not Responding / In Preview / Force Quit / Screen Share Options Blank / Error,"Hi everyone, thanks in advance for any help!

Screenshots of issues - [https://imgur.com/a/Tpjfcbb](https://imgur.com/a/Tpjfcbb)

To start, I am a bit of the default tech support guy at the company I work for but do not have any idea where to start with this issue, I have Microsoft Admin credentials if that will help with [troubleshooting.](https://troubleshooting.To) To compound this, the user is on Mac, and I have zero experience using or troubleshooting a Mac. I have not been able to find any answers online that have gotten this to work consistently for him.

I am trying to help a co-worker who is intermittently having issues running Teams on his Mac. When we had originally set up his account a few months ago everything was running smoothly for the most part. Now it seems like more often than not, he is experiencing trouble with Teams booting up, staying connected, freezing, giving errors, and not populating the selection of windows when he is trying to screen share. Oftentimes he is not able to get the program to start at all and it will show ""Application Not Responding"" when he looks at the icon on the taskbar.

We have tried both the browser version and the App and are having issues with both. As can be seen in the images I linked to, he will sometimes get a message saying ""Teams is in preview in Safari"" when trying to run the App, this doesn't go away if he closes the browser.

I appreciate any suggestions! I signed him out of all of his Apps the other day through the Admin Center, the App worked for the most part today, we then ran into the blank screen when trying to screen share, I had him scroll across the share screen window selection box and he said it was like there were no options there, and not just that the previews weren't populating. When he closed the App and tried to re-open it, it again showed the ""Application Not Responding"" message and he couldn't get the program to boot up.

Thanks again for any help, this issue has been extremely frustrating for both of us and I would really like to get him up and running!!!",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/lan76u/teams_on_mac_freezing_and_not_responding_in/,llama111

We use Direct Routing and have two Ribbon SBCs with SIP into each one.

We've created a hundred or so auto-attendants and call queues, have enabled Presence-based routing on the queues and it works fairly well... most of the time.  What we're hearing from our users (who are often members of multiple call queues) is that they're experiencing issues where they are on a call (queue call or direct to their number) and they are presented with another queue call over the top of it.  Now, my understanding of Presence-based routing is that the queue calls will only be presented to an agent if their presence is Available...

When I message trace the email address in Exchange Online, it says that all of the emails hit the system, and were forwarded to the Teams email correctly.  There's literally no difference in the tracing between emails that show up and emails that go missing.  I've checked the shared mailbox inbox, deleted items, and junk mail just in case.  No luck, those emails have just vanished.

Does anyone know why Teams Machine-Wide Installer can't just be uninstalled, machine restarted, and the Teams x64 .msi reinstalled to have Teams machine-Wide Installer back?  



www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/lb5clk/anything_to_change_for_an_uninstall_and_reinstall/

I'm using the office deployment method for Office 365, including Teams. I noticed recently that an install on a ""pure"" Windows 10 machine that's never had Office 365 works fine, like normal. But if I uninstall and then reinstall that doesn't always work. I've only tried one machine so far. I assumed uninstalling it would make it like Office 365 was not there, enough to test some deployment options. Testing was useless on that machine however. Testing on a ""pure"" machine worked as expected. For the errors a couple times Office 365 installed normally, but sometimes it just didn't install. The download was fine all times. The configure/install appeared to work. But no Office 365 showed up. That was starting fresh. In all cases, Teams Machine-Wide Installer never showed up. No sign of Teams at all, even after restarting a couple times and signing in. No Teams. No problems on a ""pure"" Windows 10 machine though. So I'm thinking just uninstalling Office 365 and Teams Machine-Wide Installer in Programs and Features isn't good enough. There's some residual settings till present that are interfering with with a second install (following an uninstall, restart, new/second install). Are there some registry settings that need to be tweaked for that? If not, in a scenario where Office 365 would be reinstalled for some reason, it means I'm better off just reimaging the machine entirely. I'd rather avoid that. If there's a new version of Office in the future that requires uninstalling Office 365, that might be another scenario where some residual Office 365 pieces have this effect. For the office deployment config file, it's as generic as you can get. It's just the current channel, x64, enterprise 365 pro. Very standard. What do I need to do to be able to completely rid a machine of Office 365 so a normal office deployment reinstall is possible? This is for Windows 10 x64 of course, not Mac.

2021-02-03 17:54:36,"Opening chat somehow ""locks"" my screen","I'm having troubles with the chat screen on my Teams.

When I am in the meeting, and open the chat during the meeting, the chat screen appears on the right side of the screen. But it somehow ""locks"" my screen so that I can't scroll it up, and I also cannot see the upper part of the window, not even the ""Show participants"" / ""Show chat"" buttons and all that. I then have to navigate back up using the tab key, and only then I can see the upper part of the window. It's a bit similar as pressing F11 for Full screen mode on Firefox, except that I cannot scroll down or up. When I close the chat screen, the window works normally, I can scroll it up and and down, I see all the buttons and so on.

We are an private education school so we often get new students termly and teacher timetable stay the same, if you add someone in a Team then they do not get the previously scheduled calendars.

This currently leaves us with two options

email all teachers to ask them to reschedule/resend once we have added them

or

Login to each student go to the teams click on invites and add to calendar.

&amp;#x200B;

Both options are timeconsuming and bit annoying this can't be automated, I can understand why this might be prefered for some and understand a setting for every request is not good for bugs, intuitive ect, but has anyone else had this issue and was able to resolve in a unique way?

Unlike my other weekly teams meetings, this one seems to not offer a join option when the meeting starts. Equally, it doesn't generate a microsoft teams notification when the meeting has started. It means i frequently miss the meeting altogether. 

The only option i have at the moment is to wait until someone writes in that meeting's chatbox. After someone writes in the chatbox, the meeting chat pops up in my chat list and I can then click the join button which appears haha.

Is this an error with the way the organiser has created the meeting? or a configuration issue with my copy of teams?

2021-02-03 22:48:54,"Teams channel creates subfolder within Files tab instead of using ""documents"" folder (specific to private channels)","I hope you read this because the title is difficult to explain:

I'm having an issue with how MS Teams is creating the backend Sharepoint folder for file storage. I can't help but feel I'm doing something wrong. This issue I'm describing specifically occurs when you create a private channel within a team.

Let's say I have a team named ""Project Greenspace"".

* A ""General"" channel is automatically created
* I created another **public** channel named ""Project Management""
* I created a **private** channel named ""Core Project Team""

When all is said and done, I have the following structure on the backend Sharepoint list:

* The ""Project Greenspace"" parent folder has two folders in the ""Documents""
   * General
   * Project Management
* Core Project Team isn't shown here
* Instead, there's another SP library named ""Project Greenspace - Core Project Team"" and in that documents folder is a folder named ""Core Project Team""
* So when I sync this to OneDrive, I get a folder named ""Project Greenspace - Core Project Team - Core Project Team""

This is a very long folder name because it's duplicating the name of the channel (specifically occurs when you create a private channel). Is there any way around this? It's creating confusion and just looks bad.

2021-02-04 18:01:38,My Frustrations with MS Teams,"My company has been using MS Teams for 2 years now, and I am the system admin. I decided to compile here a list of all my frustrations with MS Teams. It is a great tool, but several unfixed bugs and annoyances really piss me off.

1. No Reply (quote) on desktop apps. - Seriously? It has been over 2 years and they STILL can't implement this on the desktop apps? It just makes the mobile-desktop experience very inconsistent. Sometimes i will even open my phone, just to go into a group chat and be able to reply to a specific message in a chat. This is the most upvoted feature request in their [community](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/39353152-reply-to-specific-message-in-chat-on-desktop-app), with over 40,000 votes, and still being ignored for more than 1 year.
2. Notifications show, but actual message doesnt appear in chat. (I have reported this bug on a previous post in this /r ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/lccd45/ms_teams_shows_notification_but_message_doesnt/))). Basically, sometimes we get notificed of a message in a chat, but the message does't actually show up in the chat until you exit the chat and go back into it.
3. The white (blinding) splash screen, even after enabling dark mode (android) - Microsoft has implemented a dark mode on the app, but, there is still a blinding white screen every time the app reloads. Small problem, but should be a simple fix.
4. The Wiki in channels - It is ABSURD how bad and crippled the default wiki is in the teams. No way to export the articles, no way to print the articles, no search (!!!) , images pasted into the wiki sometimes simply disappear after a while, you can't copy the content with images and paste it word (for example), no revision history.
5. They have been promissing SIP calls and SIP Integration for over 1 year, (for calling into Teams Meetings with Video-conferencing devices) but nothing yet.
6. ""URGENT!"" messages - Seriously, this is insane. Urgent messages bypass even Android's ""DO NOT DISTURB"" setting. Our company has people in different parts of the world and people were getting woken up by messages marked as ""urgent"" by other team members. It is crazy that [MS states that this is the intended behaviour](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams/android-how-to-stop-quot-urgent-quot-messages-from-bypassing/m-p/1706516). I had to disable urgent messages in my entire org to avoid this.

Edit:

7. I forgot to mention how BAD the search in chat is (on Mobile). If you try to search for a message in the chat, sometimes it doesn't work at all, and when it does, it simply takes you to the chat. So, if I search for a message that was sent months ago, it only takes me to the latest message in that same chat. Then I have to scroll all the way, to find the message in the chat. So, the search is useless.",1.0,64.0,0.88,71.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/lccipl/my_frustrations_with_ms_teams/,YankeeLimaVictor

2021-02-05 00:14:17,Recording Microsoft Teams and how you can get the layout correct,"Hi,  


When recording Microsoft Teams it seems to put everyone with camera on in squares of a certain shape - who is where and what shape they are appears random depending on how many people etc.  

It is great that now Teams doesn't actually record people with no camera on as source but it does mean that sometimes someone is very big and others are a lot smaller.  Has anyone found out how teams decides to position people when recording.

4 people with video I assume is 4 uniform squares.   But if odd number you get someone in an odd number of squares..  

Does ""fit to frame"" or Spotlight affect the recording at all or does the person who hits the record button make a difference?

Part of my gig is basically ""make-users-happy"" in an Enterprise environment. So, I monitor Teams group chats to keep an eye out for high volumes of griping about the tools we support (I don't stalk these group chats - they all know I'm there keeping an eye out for them).

Wonder if someone can assist me here. We were recently contracted to deploy a Logitech Tap system at a customer site. Due to the covid situation, we have had to ship the kit to site &amp; get someone on-site to fit this for us.

Trying to create a meeting policy and would like to assign it to a group. I would prefer to assign it to a synced on-prem group as we don't have any good processes for automating AAD groups at this time.

I'm able to assign the policy to a synced group, but the policy doesn't apply to the group members. I created a AAD security group, assigned the policy to it, and the users had the policy applied to them. I then tried to nest the synced group in the AAD group, but no luck. The only way I got the policy to apply was either assigning it directly to the user or use an AAD group with the users being members of it.

If synced groups can't be used for policy assignments, I don't understand why they allow you to assign one to them. Am I doing anything wrong? Any advice would be really appreciated!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/lh3wh5/meeting_policy_group_policy_assignment/,x-omega-x

I've got a client who has multiple M365 Premium licenses and is fully using Teams/Sharepoint for file-sharing, communication etc

This isn't a feature, it's a ridiculously bad decision by the devs. The options menu even partially obscures the preview of your avatar making it difficult to notice that it's your screen.

2021-02-11 15:28:45,Teams freezes Windows,"Hi! 

My aunt is a primary school teacher and given the pandemic, her school shifted to use teams as the online learning platform. Teachers are expected to use their personal devices (i know but third world country so gotta live with it). She used to complain that teams is pretty slow so I did what I could within her budget and upgraded her hardware to an SSD and 8GB RAM. 

Now she complains that when the kids switch on video all together, her computer freezes to an extent that even the cursor doesn’t move. She says that when the kids switch on video one by one this problem is not so much. I don’t have physical access to help her but after the SSD upgrade, I have formatted her laptop and the only thing installed is teams and Office. 

Also she says that she borrowed a Mac from her friend (from description I assume it’s the 2019 MacBook Air base model) and she has no issues with all the kids switching on video in one go. Obviously she doesn’t have the budget for a Mac or even a new budget Windows laptop for that matter.

Opening Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files with AIP works fine in Teams/SharePoint.  PDF's open to the a message saying ""This is a protected document.  You can view it using a supported PDF reader app."".  Opening PDF's that don't have AIP setup works fine so I know Teams/SharePoint can view them.

A workaround is downloading the PDF and opening it in Adobe or Edge.  However this workaround is unappealing and takes extra time and disk space.

Does anyone know a way to make Teams/SharePoint open AIP protected PDF's?",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/lhpcso/opening_aip_protected_pdfs_in_teamssharepoint/,Lucalus

Basically, we want all staff to have the option of being on the call in real-time, or being able to access the recording link which is sent round via email afterwards. We also do not want to have to manually update the attendee list. This call takes place twice weekly, every week.

We currently do this via a Teams Chat channel which staff are invited to and can attend over video or voice on desktop or mobile. The session is recorded and then shared with attendees. The issue is that we need staff not on the attendee list to be able to view the video recording. If emailed the link currently they get a ‘no permission error’. We do not want to have to manually add all staff to the teams chat, or manually add staff as they join/remove them when they leave.

I seem to be running:

**Version: 8.5.0**

**Build: 5548807**

As seen from the Development -&gt; Show Electron Version menu.

Settings -&gt; General no longer has the tick-box available for this ""experience"".

I would prefer to keep Teams in a single window, and, most importantly, I personally loathe the floating miniature window that follows around my various Spaces in macOS.  I use those heavily, and it's quite distracting, plus, it breaks the macOS UI experience a bit in that  you have to double click on the Teams icon in the Dock to return to where the Teams application is located; a single click just brings the floating window to the foreground, which isn't what I wanted.

At any rate, does anyone know if there's a way to disable this multi-window view?  Or, at the very least, completely disable the following/floating window?

 I'm trying to gather information about how moving from DR to CP might work in practice.  
I explain myself: let's suppose that you have some hundreds or thousands accounts on Teams using Direct Routing phone numbers.  
Then you decide to migrate your direct routing phone numbers from your telephony provider to Microsoft.

I am wonder what happens at that point.  
Are you supposed to manually re-assign all phone numbers to users in order to specify the emegency location (for US/UK users)?  
Or does Microsoft takes care of that?  


I'm also trying to understand what happens when you migrate from SfB to Teams and, at the same time, you migrate your phone numbers to calling plan.

2021-02-19 22:24:38,Frustrations with new position,"Last month I took on a new role in my company. It feels like every day I get a new email referencing a new file that I didn’t previously have. Or I get an email saying “that file was sent the other day. You should have it.” Or “that’s the old file here is the new one. Make sure to get ride of any old documents.”

I get it. Maybe I just need to be better organized with the onslaught of emails I now get. 

In my previous role I was one of the leads on a team that communicated with 75 other people via a Microsoft Team that I set up. We organized our important files within teams and when a new person came along we just pointed them to our Wiki page and the files they needed to reference. I had a power automate set up to send them a welcome message in the General section with links and everything when a new user joined the team. It was perfect!

My new group has never used Teams beyond meetings and is completely against it. There is only 9 of us and from my perspective setting up a centralized place at least for files would be a tremendous improvement. Instead of the hundreds of emails forwarding and copying in people with files attached and then each of us having to do our own administrative work organizing and managing the files.

2021-02-19 22:25:20,Why does Teams only show some Planner boards and not all of them?,"If we go into the Teams app and into a Channel and + to add a new tab, select Planner and then create a new board, it appears under ""Tasks by Planner"" on that menu option, but how do we view the dozens of Planner boards that already exist on the web?  I have so many like personal tasks ones yet they don't appear in Teams.  We have so many duplicates, because we'll have like ""Sales Campaign"" on Planner on the web, but then users try to pin it in Teams and the only options are ""Create a new Plan"" or ""Use an Existing from this team"" yet it doesn't list any of them even though that Planner board on the web IS under that Team/Channel.  The only time the ""use existing plan"" populates is if you're selecting a plan created prior above from inside Teams.

Recently went from wired headphones to SoundPeats TRUENGIN2. They are solid Bluetooth headphones (for the cost) and haven't had any real problems until I started to use them with TEAMS.

I changed from my wired headphones because I was getting several static shocks per day with the cold weather and rubbing wire. 

The Bluetooth connects directly to my laptop. The sound quality is OK on TEAMS calls for work but is a little 'buggy' for lack of a better word. Goes in and out or has random second pauses. I was messing around in the settings and found I can use Stereo compared to the 'Hands Free AG Audio'. 100% improvement, more clear and smooth sound on calls however with this setting the Video is now about 1 second out of sync. If i flip back mid call to the Audio setting the sync catches up perfect.

Tried messing around in my Control Panel settings as well with no solution. Anyone have any problems with video sync issues with a Stereo setting on Bluetooth they were able to solve?

I also used to get calls also forwarded to my personal iPhone, but it would interrupt my music playing or if I’m in the car and got a call the call would ring until someone answered. I got so annoyed by this happening that I shut off calls coming into my phone, and now I’m just notified via my computer, which is fine. 

All of a sudden a few days ago I started getting calls on my iPhone again after months of it not happening. It’s been interrupting things I’m doing on my phone until myself or someone in my department answers the call. 

Is there a way to shut this off? It looks like the settings in the Teams app is already toggled off for calls on the General activity section. Also in the calling section of settings, call forwarding is toggled off.

The students have no ability to kick me out. I am the organizer and they are just participants.

The closest solution I have would be to use hashtags.  So I could #HR #constraint within the message and then it would be searchable.  The only issue is, this has to be done in the message text and so can only be done by whoever is writing the message.

We're trying to organize a (relatively small) event and when we started to look into potential platforms MS Teams reached the top of our list quite quickly. However we have some questions, in particular about live streaming and required versions. A part of our event will be live broadcasting speakers and an interview, this part should be fine, we're working on the tech part with an external party and we're making sure to get an account the required version. However the other part of our event will be small workshops, where we split the 'crowd' into breakout rooms and several guest speakers will give a small workshop from the comfort of their own home. That's mainly where our questions began, mainly **is it even possible to use breakout rooms in a Teams live event?**   
And if it's not, could using a regular meeting be a good alternative? We're looking to hit around 100 people so it's well within the limits but we're more worried about the practical side, can a meeting sustain that many people and still run smooth? And can we for example turn off everyone's mic and video all at once to avoid interference? 

There's another questions we couldn't find the answer to, **if we're doing breakout rooms do the people who give the workshop need their own 'premium' teams account?** In live events you can appoint 'producers', do you need a premium account to be assigned the producer role? Or, if live isn't an option due to the lack of  a breakout rooms option, is the role of the workshop giver the same as everyone else in the meeting? 

I'm sorry if some these questions seem obvious, there's a whole lot of information out there but if you're not really sure what you're looking for or how to describe what you're looking for if can be very difficult to find answers online, so I figured my best shot would be here.

&amp;#x200B;

We use teams calling (Co-Existence set to Teams Only) for our calling center, have not had any issues until about 4-5 months ago when we lost the ability to transfer calls when customers dial in to our call queue. This is the call flow:

End users call into our phone number (either the toll free or local number) &gt; greeted with the call queue/available options &gt; user selects applicable options and is routed to the applicable team. A Technician answers the call via the desktop client. If the technician needs to transfer to an external number (IE an employees cell phone), the call fails and the end user is hung up on. At this point I've escalated and escalated internally with Microsoft to no avail. After troubleshooting we noticed that through the mobile application, using the exact same call in process, we can transfer to external phone numbers; this is the same case for the web app. Both of these options are less than ideal. I am just curious if anyone has witnessed these same issues, and what was done to resolve them?

Given that everybody is mentioned in the post, I can't seem to find a way to avoid being notified every time this happens because even turning off notifications for a given channel/Team still excludes personal @ mentions, including the general Team-wide / channel-wide ones.

Is there anyway to replicate in Teams what the core UI of Skype for Business is like (i.e. show me a list of people in my organization that I can quickly chat with)?

I see there is a 'contacts' section buried under the 'Calls' tab but, regardless of how counterintuitive that is, the Contacts list there only shows 3 people who I manually added to my work phone contact list many years ago, as opposed to Skype for Business, which magically has everyone listed in our entire organization.",1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/lrhjxr/where_can_i_see_a_list_of_contacts_and_their/,coip
2021-02-25 01:13:40,Diagnosing Teams Connectivity Issues,"Greetings fellow Teamsters

I have a client network that is experiencing issues when it comes to Teams. In general, audio and video calls are unreliable, and sometimes won't run for long periods (but sometimes do).

I have wireshark traces of some of these issues and I can see Teams is using both UDP and TCP in different (to it) situations. UDP sessions seem to work the best, until the STUN/TURN sessions hit some kind of hiccup which is signaled by ""malformed packets"" near the end of the flow. The user experiences the session freezing or dropping altogether when this happens. TCP is much less reliable, collapsing fairly quickly into retransmissions and duplicate ACKs.

This happens both on wireless and wired connections to multiple computers.

I've ruled out all the low hanging fruit:

* bandwidth through the network is good (even while Teams issues are happening)
* congestion is low or non-existent
* there is no arp stealing or ethernet looping happening
* firewall has no restrictions on packet flow and has all application-layer-gateway things turned off
* the network passes all the ""Microsoft Skype for Business Network Assessment Tool"" tests

I've been looking at this for a week and I still can't figure it out.

Does anyone have any ideas what else I can look for?

Is there a way to grab some kind of logs from Teams that might tell me what Teams thinks is happening when things go to heck?

Edit: Cleaned up the wording to better illustrate the problem.

Edit 2: Found the issue. There were some adjustments needed inside the policy to block it on both ends. Why the default setup is to just flag it on one end of the pipe is beyond me but that was it...

I've spend a few hours searching forums. I've crawled the registry, uninstalled and re-installed Teams, Repaired Outlook, but the Webex Link is persisting in any Teams Meeting Invites and I can't seem to find out out to edit it out short of blowing away the entire user profile and starting from scratch.


I'm assuming there's some file, some registry key that is holding this text and hyper-link information and I just need to edit it out and it's not being overwritten on a Fresh Teams install or Office repair.


Anyone have any suggestions?",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/lt0r3f/how_to_remove_webex_link_from_teams_invite_after/,jagnew78

2021-02-27 00:16:43,Can CAPs dial out or forward calls externally?,"We are trying to set up a few phones as Common Area Phones (CAP) in Teams. We are not using any MS calling plans but routing calls through our PSTN. 
We have all users but maybe 15 of 300+ left to migrate. Voice routes, dial plans and such are left at Global for now. 
Set up a phone as a CAP, assigned the CAP license. Granted a user a CAP IP Phone policy created. 

I cannot dial out of network, nor is there an option for call forwarding. 

We were working with our partner on this, but our very knowledgeable contact moved on half way into this project and the new contact has little knowledge on large parts of Teams calling features.

Up until a couple of weeks ago, she was able to share individual program windows in meetings - like normal. Now, she only has the choice to share her desktop, and the program windows themselves have an X on them, and when she tries to share them, other people only see a black screen.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never seen that before... has anyone? I've tried searching for a solution Everywhere but have been unsuccessful so far.

I've attached a picture of what she sees when she tries to share the screen. (file names and actual desktop blurred out).

2021-02-27 23:45:28,I am trying to automate something in Teams and would love advice,"Hi guys, I'm new here. Never worked in an Office until very recently but at my job it's becoming apparent that Teams serves as our most integral communication tool.  But at my job it is also an earning tool.

Incoming calls are sporadic at my job but extremely lucrative. We have big monthly bonuses (thousands of dollars) if we can collect enough. Outbound dialing rarely results in a sale but the incoming calls are almost 80% likely to earn.

Anyway, the incoming calls are posted in a Teams chat and basically the first person to respond with their extension gets the call. It's very competitive and downright unfair as some people have newer computers/better connections that respond quicker. 

I wanted to automate this basically. A program that reads a specific phrase in Teams, responds with my extension, and then deactivates so I can take the call (and reactivate when I manually tell it to so I don't take another call while I am in one.) 

I was going to use Zap but I am not an administrator. Not sure if there are any workarounds. Let me know guys!",1.0,2.0,0.75,12.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/ltqr5x/i_am_trying_to_automate_something_in_teams_and/,Largedump

I have a customer with a couple yealink T56a teams phones. They have two different locations with two completely separate internet connections. It seems like they cant make any call longer than about 60 seconds before the screen on the phone says ""Searching for network"" for about 30 seconds before it changes to just ""Call Dropped"". I thought it may be due to the internet service but it is happening at both of their locations.

I have tried basic network connectivity troubleshooting by having constant pings going to the phone, the router, and the internet while testing and there are no packets being lost even when the phone is searching for a network.

Any ideas on what I could look into as far as what is causing the drops? Im not sure if I should be looking into the network connectivity in both locations, or the internet connections, or just go straight to blaming microsoft.

I'm going to bring one of their phones to my office and try from here as well just as a test as soon as I can.

Edit: I brought one of the phones to my office and plugged it in and made several long phone calls with zero issues. Looks like it must be a network issue at their building.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: I took the phone and plugged it directly into the spectrum connection, bypassing their current router, and it works perfectly. So Now I am suspect of the Cisco 891F router they have in place. I've been wanting to get a NGFW in there for a while now so I am going to see if they would be interested in upgrading.

They also removed the Dropdown to quickly switch between teams so now you have to click 2 times to switch. it's a PITA, but it works.

So with this, if you are tagged or have an alert enabled, you will have no client indicator telling you about the tag. If you use the web client or the mobile client - it is still there and works as expected - just not the desktop client.

So we keep missing tags and calls. Fun stuff.

I'm at a loss of figuring out why this happens. It only happens to **some** students with **some** files and it seems random to me. Other students can access the file fine.

Things I have checked already:

* The students are team members.
* The access requests shows their correct e-mail address, so they are logged into the right account.

Interestingly the same things happens when sharing files directly from OneDrive for Business. Even when I create a ''view only'' link sharing it with ''anyone with the link'' (so also people outside the organization without login), it still pop-ups access requests for some students. When I open the link myself (using the incognito mode of my browser) it works fine. Sharing the same file from my consumer OneDrive works fine too.

2021-03-04 05:41:42,HELP: Looking for Early Adopters for our Team Management SaaS app built for O365 users," 

Hello Redditor's

Need your help, we are 2 months away from rolling out our product but we are running out of cash. So I am offering a **2-year subscription to our software for the first 1000 users for $50.**

**About us**

It all began at a Florida cleaning company back in 2006.

That year, when I took over a small struggling cleaning company in dire need of a reliable quoting system for the sales team. I turned to Elance, the premier freelancing platform now called Upwork, to find developers to build the system. Finding the developers was easy; however, managing them was an entirely different matter. Even with these challenges, our tool helped us generate over $2 million in 2 years as well as making Inc 500 list of fastest-growing companies.

By 2012 due to the great recession, I started on a new path - remotely working as a Microsoft SharePoint consultant, but I was still struggling to stay connected and aligned with my clients. As a manager, it was a challenge. But as an entrepreneur, I saw a business opportunity.

I pulled together a team from all over the world to get access to the best talent, and our global remote team stretching from Miami to India, Pakistan, and the Philippines was born.

We grew. But so did our challenges:

* Setting clear and measurable company, team, and individual goals
* Allowing team members to see what their coworkers were working on 
* Enforcing the discipline of daily planning and aligning work to goals
* Centralizing access to all their work, no matter which tools they used
* Tracking progress without the need for meetings or status reports

With so much experience with M365 and SharePoint, we decided to build a tool to empower M365 subscribers to feel and be more productive with routines and automation for successful daily planning, work prioritization, and accountability.

We have been using it over the past few months to manage our team and it has been a game-changer for us.

 **Our Tool is a complete toolkit for successful remote teamwork with seamless integration with M365, here is a partial list of features:**

1. **Check-Ins** \- Routines to get you energized for work and help teams plan a balanced, goal-focused agenda by automatically aggregating their work from To Do's, planner, OneNote, OneDrive, Outlook, and more.
2. **Agenda** – A road map of your day – meetings, scheduled breaks, tasks, flagged emails in a single view.
3. **Activities** – Monitor team morale, availability, and what they plan to work on each day across multiple time zones.
4. **Goals** – a simple progress tracking framework that seamlessly integrates into your team’s daily routine.
5. **Check Outs** \- End of day routines to help remote teams feel a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.
6. **Automations** – pre-built templates to automate your workflows with Power automate and our tool.

2021-03-04 14:16:26,"Multiple accounts in Teams: ""Pick an account to continue"" vs ""email/password re-authentication""","I have 2 separate accounts with 2 separate organisations (separate tenants) within Teams, using 2 different email addresses. When I sign out of Teams, I'm presented with the following screen that allows me to 1-click sign in to any of my other accounts (the 3rd one listed at the bottom is an account that was briefly added as a guest to another tenant which it no longer has access to).

[this is what I see after fully signing out of teams - the black bars are the 3 email addresses I have used with Teams at some point or other in the past](https://preview.redd.it/pydwfo5ocyk61.png?width=842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14031979c035b969c272d002b1f541d6d3fce736)

My colleagues do not have this option, and when signing out of Teams they have to sign back in with an email address and a password (see below). I want them to be able to easily sign in and out between their different accounts the same way I can.

[this is what my colleagues see when signing out of teams entirely -- they have to re-authenticate with their full email and password which is quite inconvenient](https://preview.redd.it/u6nouv85eyk61.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46332f606c37107492eae072e9d328d399031091)

I want to understand why I see this (in my opinion, simply better) option to 1-click sign in but they do not. We are all on Windows 10, on version 1.4.00.4167 (64-bit) of Teams, so I don't understand why we are seeing different options.

Another difference is in the way we can switch between tenants that we have access to as guests using the same email address. For me, the option is buried under my profile picture menu followed by ""Accounts &amp; orgs"", but for them it is simply a dropdown menu next to the name of their currently signed in organisation and they do not need to click on their profile picture. See the following pictures (dark theme is me, light theme is my colleague).

Hi,

A few days ago I (think) I got a new Teams update. The whole app went into dark mode, and I noticed that no icons would appear. Everything was either a gray default icon, and everyone was a default grey icon, everyone's pictures disappeared, and those who didn't have it, but had their initials shown, also disappeared. After restarting my PC I had a bigger issue, nothing would load. I wasn't able to access any of my classes, chats, or calendar through the app. Note that everything works on my Mac and Phone.

I un-installed Teams, and tried re-installing it. The App gets stuck in the ""splash screen""

(this one for reference) for about 45 minutes. After which it asks me to choose an account, I try to log in, type in my email, hit enter. Wait another 30 minutes (I am not exaggerating) after which I get a notification informing me that an error occurred and I should try again later. I've first had this issue over 24 hours ago and it's starting to be a big issue for me.

We had several calls with Microsoft support so far with no luck, they asked us to provide different systems to the users which we did but the same error occurs.

If I for example would login to their system and logon to Teams it works just fine so this makes me think it is really an account issue. However neither our MSP or Microsoft believes its an account issue.

We are running a Hybrid environment with On-premise exchange and Active Directory.  
I just have a feeling there is either an attribute or something else triggering this behavior.

When you look online you find similar cases that got self resolved, in our case so far it did not.

2021-03-09 17:16:22,Bookmark/Favourite files,"Hi all, 

I'm an IT Consultant in the UK and during the past year have used Teams and now Gsuite a lot for collaboration etc. The company my wife works for implemented Teams during lockdown and it's been great to see her using the tech, asking me questions on how to do 'stuff'. She even held a best practice session with her team to show them how well it can be used.

She recently had a problem with finding a particular file she's worked on with another team member who also couldn't remember the name of the file. I said why don't you bookmark/favourite the file or files so you can easily refer back to them when needed. I use this feature a lot in my currently role using Google Drive. I checked her Teams and whilst you can save a chat, you can't favourite a file easily. To further complicate the situation, my wife had an illness called Encephalitis, one of the long term side effects for her has been loss of short term memory. Things like file names just aren't committed to her long term memory, so she got quite stressed not being able to find this document. Stress for her now is different, it really takes a toll on her and can get quite down as she thinks its her brain not remembering, actually the tools we use don't currently help her.

I Googled for a solution, and it seems this isn't a feature in Teams as yet and has been requested over the years heavily by the userbase on the MS User Voice. People have found workarounds, using Delve or opening the file via a linked Sharepoint, but that is overly complicating the situation. As a workaround, she's started using OneNote (she's really got the hang of that!) to save links to the files in a one pager. I pinged MS Teams on Twitter and they sent me a link to the current UserVoice post.

I'm reaching out to this Teams community to post on the User Voice and request this feature heavily. It would really help my wife out in her day to day work and help lower her stress levels.

It's been absolutely brilliant seeing her using the tools I've implemented at many companies for years and actually listening to me as a tech on how to use apps to get her through her day, the least I can do is push the tech to add features where possible to help her.

I must say I would never expect that the level of frustration can be so high - it almost looks like MS is trying some alpha versions on the smaller customers. It comes from various points...

1. Log in experience - Logging in for the first time is a big pain. Most of the people had big troubles with associating the authenticator app with their account and it seemed nearly impossible to get rid of the old account we used to have for the test trial. I personally spent hours trying to log in for the first time.
2. MS Office - Oh my god! I would never imagine it can be so bad... ever!
   1. Logging in to the desktop app - so you download the Office package and you log in during the first launch using your company profile. But you still cannot open or save anything from the Teams sharepoint! So another digging just to figure out that you need to log in for the second time using the same account to see the shared data. What kind of people can invent such user experience?
   2. Collaboration (MS Word). OK, so you have the fully matured desktop app full of functions. Obviously the web version is a lot more lightweight but that is OK. I just prepare the document in the Desktop and then share the link to the webapp with our externals to help me fill in the missing stuff.... wait a minute, what? Why does the document formatting looks crippled in the online version? Like completely crippled, especially when you use the images to prepare marketing like brochure documents.   
Okay, never mind, let's try to fix the formatting in the web version. Oh no, that broke the formatting in the desktop app again!

After perusing the web for a bit and being unable to find an answer elsewhere, and then after perusing this subreddit and being unable to come across a solution, I will simply pose it directly: How does one (if one can) apply a custom, branded background for Teams that will scale appropriately of multiple people are spotlighted?  I have a 1920x1080 background that for some, appears in full and for others appears cut off, same image file though.  Additionally, when multiple people are speaking and take a spotlighted position, the image is cut down to size and only half the logo appears.  Obviously this is an issue.

Is the solution to simply center the logo and cross my fingers, or does Teams allow for a scaling solution, on the fly?

Which one offers the most flexibility where staff do not have to be dedicated to taking calls? For example, of an employee steps away from their desk for a moment to ask a coworker a question we would not want them placed into a Missed Call state (maybe that gets reported, however the functionality of getting customer phone calls while staff have flexibility in the way they work answered is the priority).

What criteria would you look for in a call queue system that integrates with Teams?

Here are a few:

1. No installs or updates needed (as these may require admin access meaning staff cannot take phone calls during computer updates...unless there is integration on mobile devices).
2. Works on mobile
3. Functions as expected (there are no dropped calls, changing of employee statuses, does not created crazy long wait times for calls to be answered)
4. Employees can sign in to be ready to take calls or not (based on their task schedule for the day/hour).",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/m1zdr5/contact_center_with_teams_integration/,OwlClassic

2021-03-11 01:24:56,How to add a Toll Free dial in number for MS Teams (In Canada),"Hi All, 

I deployed Teams with our O365 hybrid deployment earlier this year, but have run into a hurdle that the VP's of the company would like to address: 

Essentially, we need a Toll Free dial in option for our teams meetings. We have audio conferencing licenses for the users who need to send these invitations, but they provide a toll number which the VP's are against. 

They would like a toll free number to be assigned to the Teams meeting invites to ensure users (all in Canada) will not be charged long-distance, etc. From what I gather the process is as follows: 

1. Assign Audio Conferencing license for users sending invites w/dial-ins
2. Purchase “Communication Credits” which are basically long distance minutes for the      organization 
3. Have an existing toll-free number to port in, or request a number from MS
4. Port in said number via Teams admin console or add new number. 

A few notes: 

\-In Teams admin console, when attempting to add a new number, it says 5 toll numbers are available, but 0 toll free numbers available to assign.

\-We have not purchased communication credits yet, waiting on billing to approve.

Sorry if I am overcomplicating things, but if anyone could clarify/simplify the process of doing this (either for porting in a toll free bridge, or a new number entirely)

Questions: 

\-If toll numbers are used, will these charge to the user that is dialing in, or will the usage be deducted from communication credits?

\-What are our options to ensure users won't be billed to dial into meetings?

Some searching lead me to the reports in the office admin center, which then directs me to skype for business, which in turn bounces me right back to the teams admin center.

2021-03-12 13:03:48,Teams automated chat message from Outlook,"Here is what I am looking to do:

I would like to have Microsoft Teams send an automated message to a Teams Chat when a specific email from a specific sender is received. 


Example:

- Company A sends me an email
- Outlook communicates to Microsoft Teams that email has been received 
- Microsoft then sends a message to everyone in my Team the contents of this email

Why? We can have one person in our office the dedicated recipient of the email from Company A, and save all other employees from getting filled with Company A emails. They can then read the Teams Chat at their leisure.

- This saves people from having to sift through more emails then they need
- I am fully aware that you can filter in Outlook to accomplish a similar result, but not everyone in the office is looped into Company A's emails, nor do I feel confident they will set up filters appropriately



The solution I am contemplating is through the use of Zapier. But I didn't know if anyone has set up a similar workflow?

Please see the screenshots attached. The user is fine to log into the regular Teams hotmail account, but when they go to login to the work account they are greeted with the screenshot attached. Every single other user at our workplace running this version of Teams (latest) on windows is not running into issues. 

This is what I've tried so far:

**1** Complete removal of MS Teams from features and programs along with the removal of data stored in: 

**%appdata%\\Microsoft\\teams**

Removed targeting what was inside of:

%appdata%\\Microsoft\\teams\\application cache\\cache  
%appdata%\\Microsoft\\teams\\blob\_storage  
%appdata%\\Microsoft\\teams\\Cache  
%appdata%\\Microsoft\\teams\\databases  
%appdata%\\Microsoft\\teams\\GPUcache  
%appdata%\\Microsoft\\teams\\IndexedDB  
%appdata%\\Microsoft\\teams\\Local Storage

**2.** Removal of MS teams along with removing 

**%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Teams** entirely

**3.** Making sure TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 were both enabled via internet explorer settings 

**4.** Making sure account settings linking Steven’s device to Intune were correct. Another device email was found connected to us (similar to his Elinvar email but slightly different), so it was removed, his correct email added then linked. Tried logging into Teams again and received the same error.

**5.** Removing the regkey after performing a complete uninstallation:

**Found under:**

\[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER \\ Software \\ Microsoft \\ Windows \\ CurrentVersion \\ Run\]

""com.squirrel.Teams.Teams"" = ""C: \\\\ Users \\\\ &lt;username&gt; \\\\ AppData \\\\ Local \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Teams \\\\ Update.exe --processStart \\"" Teams.exe \\ ""- process-start-args \\ ""- system-initiated \\"" ""

**6**. Checked if any firewall or VPN was hindering any connection from being made (nothing found out of the ordinary)

**7.** Tried also another workaround on the net that was found with no luck. Navigate to the following path: %userprofile%\\appdata\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Teams. Creating a json file called hooks.json. Json file contains only {“enableProcessIntegrityLevel"": false}

Still looking into other solutions and any help would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve configured a Sonus/Ribbon SBC (r.9.0.1) to connect to Teams and everything looks good.

The only troubleshooting I can find on the Ribbon support site for this refers to NAT, but the SBC has a direct internet IP, no NaT involved. 

Any ideas? This is all g.711, no SiLK codec installed.  Maybe worth mentioning this all goes over the same interface. I’ve got the SBC logs and it seems to reference the right codecs and MSFT IPs, but I’m guessing signalling is ok but something is wrong with media from SBC to the Teams client? Where can I find ice logs for that?

Suddenly I’m wondering if the default gateway on the SBC is for the LAN interface, so it can’t reach IPs issued by the Teams client, maybe I need to turn off media bypass to check then look at the defined static routes?

I've read all the MS forum posts i could, and all the reddit threads I could, and I still haven't found a solution. I tried disabling Windows Defender and switching to different networks, but nothing worked.

**DETAILS:**

\- This is a non-scheduled meeting in an existing Team, with people in completely different regions

\- I do not have any peripherals attached to my laptop except a single wireless mouse

\- My wifi is completely fine, I've been able to access the internet and stream videos with no problems throughout the day

\- Checking the meeting logs, Teams appeared to have spat out several error messages involving ""TeamsCallsQuery returned an empty result"", suggesting it is either related to the network or to the host's end

2021-03-13 20:32:07,Teams wont use USB Camera,"Here's the thing, I use a simple USB camera, worked fine with teams the first 2 weeks and then suddenly it stopped working. 

I can use a workaround of using OBS and select it as a source, then stream that source into teams but frankly that's redundant. 

When using the Camera application in Windows itself it works fine.

When using discord and selecting video source it is recognized but only shows a green screen.

I've tried to google my way out of this one but given all the different situations I feel like I ain't gonna google guru myself out of this one. 

Any ideas?

I checked the drivers, reinstalled them, also reinstalled teams. Checked the permission and its listed there.

Ive done some tech support but thats a while ago and im just pretty much 'a user that knows google exists' at this point.

The whole 'its onenote and skype in one' or whatever our management gets all excited about is nice n stuff but as a consultant thats an intermediary for multiple teams with most of them out of our main country i mainly care about the chat function and reaching out to people that i need.

There does not seem to be an easy way to add multiple people at once to a group, i've been manually adding people to a few groups but this totals to 400+ people i'll need to re-categorize, really wonder if this is the way...

Groups do not seem to automatically re-order according to status as skype did - is there a solution for this? Alphabetical by last name seems to be the base selection and i cant find a way to change this.

Not all locations are migrating to teams in the upcoming month and it seems that i cannot send attachments to people still using skype... pretty annoying

When calls come in via a call queue if one of users in the Queue hits the ""decline"" option on the call and then someone else takes the call the call ends up getting logged under the person that declined the call and not the person that actually took the call.  We have the call queue's set to conference mode. 

When you look at call detail for parked calls it only logs the call under the person that picked up the parked call and their is no record of the person that parked the call having been involved with the call at all. 

Both of these issues are really screwing up reports that managers use to determine how much employees are on the phone.   The first issue literally encourages people to ignore the call.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/m5k9gr/call_detail_messed_up_for_call_queue_calls_and/,despich

At first glance it looks like it's got all the information I need, except I'm suspicious of the actual numbers it's reporting. Things like, of the 1600 calls reported in the last month, 20% of them dialed zero, except zero doesn't go to the operator, they had a different option go to the operator &amp; zero just restarts the AA. Do that many people really just hit zero without listening to any options?

Another suspicious thing is that I made a few test calls where I intentionally hit other options &amp; those call actions aren't being reflected in the stats. Or am I just misinterpreting what ""AACallerActionCount"" (""Caller actions count"") is referring to? Maybe that's it, there's a separate ""Caller Actions"" section in Power BI that includes named columns Hang up, Transfer to Application, Transfer to PSTN, and Transfer to User (and apparently *unknown* has a few of the calls).

2021-03-16 01:02:44,Service Desk Looking for Help,"I have a user thats having a pretty weird issue and thus far, I have not been able to replicate the issue on other machines.

Essentially, he's having audio issues. 

1) When he receives a call or HE joins a meeting, his mic does not work. When he places a call or starts a meeting, his mic works fine. 

1a) I checked all this audio settings in teams and windows, made sure the drivers were properly installed, messed with mic and audio settings &gt; everything checked out

2) When he places a call, there's a massive 15-20 second buffer before the call goes through.

2a) Cleared Teams cache&gt; No change  
2b) Uninstalled and reinstalled Teams&gt; No change

3) (Largely trivial but may be related) When he joins a meeting or receives a call and his audio does not work, his Amazon Music App stops playing music. When he leaves the call (because his mic isnt working) and goes to play music again in the Amazon Music App, the play button engages, the song bar moves, but there is no audio. He has to restart his app to get music to play through the speakers again. Again, trivial, but leads me to believe there is some audio error happening in Windows.

3a) Checked event viewer and noticed there was an application error happening when a call was placed: AUDIODG.EXE/MaxxAudioCapture64.dll

Only other thing I can think of to note is that he recalls all this happening after he updated to the latest version of Teams (1.4.00.4167) in late February.

2021-03-16 08:06:08,MS phone system and Poly VVX phones problems,"2+ years into having adopted full MS Teams with MS phone system, calling plans, with Polycom VVX 3PIP handsets and it is still as troublesome as ever. 

Callers dial in, calls are answered, and about every 2 or 3 calls, the caller can't be heard, and the call drops. Wait a few moments, try again, and it might go through successfully. Or not. Nobody can possibly operate a public facing business this way.

Some of my clients have tried the newer native Teams phones from Poly and Yealink, and while they don't seem to have this problem, there are plenty of other issues with those phones and nobody can justify replacing entire fleets of handsets that are barely 2 years old and SUPPOSED to work.

If this was just one client experiencing this, that would be one thing, but it is *every single one* of my clients. All in on being ""Teams Only"", using Polycom VVX phones. All up to date. No firewall or routing issues.. Despite repeated support tickets with MS over the years, there has never been any resolution, or determination of where the problem lies. Countless times I have provided every imaginable permutation of log files and diagnostic reports, only to go around in circles, be passed around to other groups, and start all over again being asked for the same data repeatedly. I've also tried opening tickets with Poly, but they won't unless you go through the phone vendor which we tried once and got nowhere.. 

Lately, (past 2 months) the calling issues  been particularly bad, and yet another client has decided to abandon MS in favor of another telephony provider.

I'm curious if there are others using this system as described, and how you're dealing with it? I'm at my wits end, and find it hard to accept that all these unrelated clients are experiencing this issue, and that MS isn't fully aware of it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/m5vuhl/ms_phone_system_and_poly_vvx_phones_problems/,BearDenBob

The majority of staff do not have Teams on their phone etc, so are not getting the notifications outside office hours. Is there a way I can put a time feature or something similar on Teams, so messages go to Outlook after a certain time.

1.- Is it possible to set ""busy"" times in teams calendar? I can't seem to find anything but the ""schedule meeting"" feature.

2.- Is it possible to share my teams calendar with someone else so that they can see when I am busy? (I used to be able to do this very easily with my gmail powered institutional account).

3.- If the above is not possible, can you sync your outlook calendar with teams so that what you add in your outlook calendar appears in the teams calendar and viceversa?

A member in a Teams group where I am one of the other owner is receiving an meeting invitation e-mail whenever someone in the group schedules a meeting; meetings to which the member in question has not be invited to attend. This member is the only member (of all members who are not owners) receiving these e-mails.

This member is not an owner of the Teams group; they are simply a member. I, as one of the owner of this Teams group, do receive an e-mail everytime a member schedules a meeting as it is important that I do receive these e-mails.

My attempt to troubleshoot the problem was to remove the member from the Teams group, close Teams, restart my station and then add the member to the Teams group again. This **did not** solve the issue. 

Also, I cannot find the settings in Teams which allows to configure the parameters regarding meetings and invitation e-mails.

I do not have admin access in order to verify the user's profile (Teams or AD). Therefore, I cannot attest that the issue does not lie there.

My questions are :

* Why is the member receiving all these e-mails?
* Where, in Teams, can we configure Teams to stop sending these e-mails to this member?

*Note : I think the issue lies with the user's profile (in Teams or AD) as this is the only member experiencing this issue; but IT has yet to propose a resolution to this problem which the user has been experiencing for almost a month now.*

So basically I'm currently jobless...long story. Anywho been having a few interviews and they all wish to use Team's, now I don't pay for Teams as I don't have a need too, but I do require to blur out my background on teams; Unfortunately I cannot get this to work when I'm in an interview, is it because I'm a guest ? Maybe.. However this is ruining my interviews and spoiling my chances at landing a job (due to my bed being in the background) and not being able to just pick up my PC and TV and move it to the dining room.. So I've tried to download a new version of teams and well that hasn't worked, I've also tried to ""sign up"" for teams again, but it's suggesting for me to use skype which is not helpful whatsoever, I've also viewed many MS Forums and there seems to be loads of others with the same issue with no solid answers.   
I've also looked at the pricing plans for MS Teams and even under the free version it does include backgrounds, but yet again I do not have this option when entering into a teams meeting to change the background, therefore any advice or a fix would be grateful. 

If I do have to go down the route of a pricing model, would office 365 personal at £5.99 a month include premium teams ? or will I have to have Premium teams separately at the £3.80 ?   
Otherwise if I have to enter in a ""work"" use to gain access to these features for free, but don't technically have a own company, but make one up (I have idea's) will it show on the interviewers side ? Can this be changed in the future ?

2021-03-17 01:23:31,Transitioning from Skype for Business Hybrid to MS Teams (Pure Online),"Hi,

Already , I have moved all users to the Ms Teams and  on-prem AD was synchronized to Azure AD.

When a user is synchronised to Office 365 their UPN is used to provision the identity and service addresses for MS Teams. users UPNs do not match their publically available contact information such as their e-mail address.

e.g

mail : [john@contoso.com](mailto:john@contoso.com)

UPN :  [EMPID@contoso.com](mailto:EMPID@contoso.com)

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts,possible concerns I might've overlooked, or better design choices are appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

My workflow : Correct ?

btw , we have been using ""Island mode"" at the tenant level. Also , all users like below.

    TeamsUpgradeEffectiveMode              : Islands 
    TeamsUpgradeNotificationsEnabled       : False 
    TeamsUpgradePolicyIsReadOnly           : None 
    TeamsUpgradePolicy                     : 

Now , I have some questions.

1- I don't understand "" If you're completely getting rid of all your on prem stuff, just power them off and remove them from AD, do not uninstall them because you need the Lync attributes to stay "" please clarify to me. you mention skype4b server decommission ?

My latest workflow : Correct ?

\- Move All Users to Teams

\- assign the user TeamsUpgradePolicy with mode= TeamsOnly with small batches. not tenant level. user specified policy

\- Update DNS records to point to Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

remove internal / external skype4b dns records

wait 30 minutes for propagate dns records

\- if everything is okay , set teamsonly mode at the tenant level via powershell

\- Set-CsTenantFederationConfiguration -SharedSipAddressSpace $false

\- Get-CsHostingProvider|Set-CsHostingProvider -Enabled $false

\- Poweroff skype4b VMs about 2 weeks

\- removed the last servers and ran Disable-CsAdDomain and Disable-CsAdForest.

Deleting the Teams folder in the Roaming AppData fixes the problem and allows the user to re-sign in however I’m trying to find the WHY to this issue instead of doing a brute force delete of the Teams folder.

Things I’ve looked at

-AAD Plug-in ( is installed however I receive many errors related to it in the event viewer )
-Checked Registry permissions for the above plugin as per a MS article, set correctly and no change
-Updated to numerous versions, tried four different versions and issue persists 
- Tried running Procmon to see any errors and there is nothing that stands out

My culprit is most likely the AAD plug-in as many of the errors state that “The system file path cannot be found” but then doesn’t even say what path.

I am using a very simple Bot that should respond automatically when a new message is posted in a channel. This Bot is manually activated every evening and deactivated in the morning.

The problem is that when the Bot is activated in the evening, it posts a reply to all the messages that have been posted during the day.

Hello, Everyone,

Want to introduce you to a new application that will make your lives easier! It's called ‘Anti Away Teams’. It’s very simple, really.

What it does:

• Keeps your MS Teams/Skype always online;

• Keeps your computer alive;

• It has a timer so you can set the amount of time you want your program to be active. For example: Today you will work a 9 hour shift. All you need to do is set the time and your MS Teams only goes away after 9 hours.

This application was created with the sole purpose of helping people who are teleworking.

&amp;#x200B;

I have created a new team for testing purposes, and I want to add all users that is in a security group or a distribution list to that particular team.

As stated when you want to add members to a team, it says you can search for a User, DL or Security Group, so  it should be supported, right?

&amp;#x200B;

For my testing  I have created 1 Team in MS Teams and 2 groups; 1 Distribution List &amp; 1 Security Group

This is really racking my brain. We used to have the teams exe installed on our work pcs. It worked fine, however some started to say it was out of date. Our IT solutions then deployed the MSI Machine Wide installer. And since it has been done everytime we log into our pcs we need to log into teams, but it comes up with a restart error (caa50009d) or similar. We have had to have a policy erase the teams folders in our %appdata% so we can log on.

It's a big pain having to enter our username twice to do this. Is there any way that we can have it remember our login info everytime? 

Is it better to get the exe reinstalled as that worked better?

I'm having a hard time deciphering the documentation regarding Teams Business Voice. We just started using it and have assigned numbers to users. Here are questions I can't find answers to:

1. We have additional phone numbers reserved to add more employees in the future. If they are unassigned to users, and we do not have additional user licenses for these numbers, are we charged for these? Do they dissapear after a certain time?
2. I believe everyone has audio conferencing with their Business Voice license. I have set a number as a Conference Bridge, and it looks like it is the default for every user. What happens if multiple users schedule meetings at the same time? Do I need multiple conference bridges?
3. Can everyone have their own conference bridge number, and does this cost anything extra? It doesn't look like they use Resource Accounts, so I guess you can have an unlimited number of conference bridges?
4. Finally, I have an Attendant setup that routes to our employees. Does the Attendant work if multiple people call at the same time, or does an Attendant require a Call Queue for that?",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/mgldyl/teams_voice_questions/,Muted-Gain-8322
