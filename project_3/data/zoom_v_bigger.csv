When I first install the client, it launches the UI for me to sign in, I select sign in with my Google account, it opens the sign in page in Chrome, then that wants me to launch the client (again?), and then I get stuck with zoom.exe processes taking 20-25% of my CPU without actually giving me the UI... same problem if I log in through the website then try to host a meeting (for a test run).

2020-04-02 19:13:25,"Is there an app to arrange ""Raise hand"" in order they were raised?","&amp;#x200B;

Adobe Connect has a feature where when meeting participant a uses the ""Raises hand"" feature, that participant's name is added to a separate list of those with their hands up. Importantly, **the names on that list are listed in the order that their hand went up**. (image from Adobe connect)

This is extremely helpful for hosts running large meetings (over twenty people, maybe many more). The meeting can be run with everyone muted, and the host can unmute people in the order that they raised their hand, allowing everyone a fair chance to participate and avoiding crosstalk.

Zoom has the ""Raise hand"" feature, but there's no way to tell in which order hands were raised. 

My question is: Is there a Zoom app/plugin that can implement this feature for Zoom? Is it even something the API exposes, such that creating such an app would be possible? And if so, would the app necessarily need to be installed by every participant, or could it be something only the host needs to install?

(As a company using Zoom for business use, hiring someone to make a small app to enable this feature is a possibility, if no such app yet exists).",1.0,1.0,NA,5.0,/r/Zoom/comments/ftkjpw/is_there_an_app_to_arrange_raise_hand_in_order/,Potenzo

I work IT for a City in the State I live in. Like many businesses and municipalities, our Council and Business meetings have gone 100% digital while Coronavirus is a threat. I’m currently trying to find a good way to allow for public input during meetings; the last three weeks, the Public has not had any way to call in and ask questions, make comments, etc.

I was going to create a dedicated phone line where residents could call in one at a time (I don’t anticipate huge volume), but was wondering if anyone else has a solution they would like to share which has worked well for them.

That is against Tradition 3 and that is not what AA is about.

I want to have 3 breakout sessions during the class.  The first one 15 minutes into the class, the second one 2 hours in, and the third one during the last 45 minutes.
 
The first two breakout sessions are not a problem.   I will break the class up into groups of two people per room.  Forty people, two to each room, twenty rooms, allow Zoom to automatically create and populate the groups.  Easy to do.

The third break out session is where the problem lies.  Again, this session is to be held during the last 45 minutes of the class.  There will be two rooms.  One room will be for parents who have children who are preteens and teens, the other room will be for parents who have younger children.  This means the rooms will need to be populated manually.  
I will need to ask each class participant which of the two rooms s/he will want to be in, and then assign them to the appropriate room.  This will be a time consuming process.  I cannot imagine doing this just before the last breakout session is about to begin.

What I want to do is create and populate this 3rd breakout session as the participants are being checked-in at the beginning of the class. And then hold that session until the last 45 minutes of the class.

When the users are signed in as their basic accounts and create the meeting through the plugin, if the meeting exceeds 40 minutes there is a warning that pops up. All that makes sense except that we are only using Outlook/their account to schedule said meeting with a **formal** looking invite to their recipients. The users will then be utilizing the zoom room to facilitate their meeting but we want to make sure they don't hit that limit.

We've recreated this problem across various apps - games, youtube in the browser, spotify, etc. 

It seems like my computer is dimming it's audio so I can hear others in theory, but in practice, at least through my speakers, there is no drop in app audio, it's only happening on their end.

I am on windows 10 and have been through every possible setting I can find with someone on the other end, and we have not been able to determine why it does this.  I've reinstalled drivers (creative sound blaster) and tried virtual cable solutions with voicemeeter as well.

2020-04-08 13:09:34,Net to set the record straight about zoom,"I can't take this Zoom bashing any more. Zoom is a great product with some flaws. But first, we need to differentiate between issues with zoom and issues with the use of zoom. 

Zoombombing is the product of a poor implimentation of the product into the learning environment. Because so many schools turned to zoom in an instant, there was zero thought about how to manage the security of it. This is on the schools. Typically an enterprises roll out would take months. This took a weekend, maybe. So naturally not ideal. So zoom bombing is a product of this. Kids want to disrupt school, it's in their dna. 

This will get resolved, but it isn't zooms fault. 

The privacy issues are more on zoom to fix, but they are part of a broader issue with the tech industry as a whole. Zoom just has a microscope on it right now. Their app has had some issues, which they claim are being fixed, but on the whole its a great product - especially when compared to other web conferencing tools. 

The encryption stuff is definitely something 99% of you will NOT have an issue with, unless you use phone or SIP calls. The App is encrypted. So if you're into tin hats, don't use phone audio. 

This is the while point, this tool is a fantastic web conferencing tool. It is easy to host, easy to install, easy to connect small and large groups of people. It just works. For those of us that have used other legacy conferencing products know this. So don't sleep on zoom. It has what you need and if your concerned about some of it, that's cool. But know its the best product out there for this time. And for God sake, read the user manual!",1.0,1.0,NA,10.0,/r/Zoom/comments/fx097l/net_to_set_the_record_straight_about_zoom/,a_humanoid

I have two motivations for this:

1. I'm a roboticist and obsessed with robots
2. I am using Zoom a lot now and want to just make it more interesting by having a library of robot themed virtual background for me and the community to use on calls

I am offering a few free copies of my book (written by me Dr. Robin Murphy) to help give an extra incentive for to get involved (not that they usually need it) but get no benefit from this other than hopefully a number of fun new robot backgrounds to use. 

If you want any information on the books I've written or the terms of the free book, you can find them here -  [https://www.roboticsthroughsciencefiction.com/single-post/2020/04/03/Competition-Create-the-Best-Robot-Background-for-Zoom](https://www.roboticsthroughsciencefiction.com/single-post/2020/04/03/Competition-Create-the-Best-Robot-Background-for-Zoom)

I’m at my wits end with Zoom. I deleted it and redownloaded it, tried getting it both directly from the website and through my university, and no matter what I do, I ALWAYS get Error 5003. I join in browser for the time being, but yesterday I had a meeting organized by a student at another university and the zoom link brought me to a login page for that university, which I couldn’t get into. Other people in the meeting are students at that university and they didn’t have that problem, so I assume it’s linked with me constantly getting error 5003.

I’m on a Mac, if it helps. I can deactivate or activate anything you want, change my settings and all that, but you’ll have to walk me through.

I beg you please, solve my problem, you’ll be my hero.

2020-04-10 00:37:14,Optimizing Screen Sharing in Zoom,"So for the past several weeks I've had to do a lot of screen sharing of videos in Zoom. Some days it has worked great, but others I end up with a lot of dropped frames and very choppy playback. My computer seems to have more than enough processing power and I don't appear to be using anywhere near my full upload bandwidth. OBS, for example, seems to be able to provide much better video output than Zoom, but for various reasons I need to continue using Zoom. So, I'm just looking for input from others on what settings they've used to optimize their screen sharing. Some particular things I'm wondering about:  
\-I just have an integrated Intel graphics card on my laptop; should I ""enable hardware acceleration for screen sharing"" or would it be better to disable this since I have a decently powerful CPU?

\-I'm doing full screen video sharing on a monitor set at full HD resolution (1080p). If I set my monitor to a lower resolution, than in theory there should be more bandwidth so less dropped frames, right? Has anyone experimented with this? I'd rather have a lower resolution video playing at 30fps than a higher resolution video that is really choppy.

\-In advanced settings, Zoom has four different ""Screen capture modes"" but I can't find any documentation on what the difference is between them. I'm wondering if changing my mode might help?",1.0,1.0,NA,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/fxvo8h/optimizing_screen_sharing_in_zoom/,dtfromca

2020-04-10 04:38:59,"Suggestions/Recommendations for Restricting Live Zoom Meetings and Pre-Recorded Video Content to Paid Memberships (Wordpress/Ultimate Membership Pro, Vimeo, Zoom)","This is a bit lengthy but its necessary in order to explain. I am sure there are others who are &amp; will be looking for a solution to this same or similar situation. 

I am a web designer.  I'm working with a dance studio in NYC to implement a membership website that gives paid members access to live Zoom classes and a library of pre-recorded video content (Vimeo pro).  My client has already switched her dance studio clients to Zoom classes and is managing their monthly payments manually.

Our objective is to enable paid members to have access to unlimited monthly live classes and unlimited access to recorded video content.

She is already doing the live classes and the video content is already recorded.

So here is where I am at.

\------

**Technology Currenly Being Used or Thinking About Using / Purpose Of**

(open to suggestions if there is a better way to approach)

Wordpress/Themify - Website

Zoom Pro account - Live 2-Way Classes

Ultimate Membership Pro - Membership management/content restriction for members on wordpress

Vimeo Pro - To host video content and restrict access to members accessing it via member-restricted wordpres pages

She also has a Punchpass account, which integrates Zoom with a pay-per-class scheduling/registration platform.  The class schedule can be embedded in the website but I'm not sure there is going to be a way to make it restrict access to paid Ultimate Membership Pro members, so this may not be an option.

Stripe - payment processing

I am aware of this Zoom-Wordpress plugin but have not tried it out yet.   [https://elearningevolve.com/products/wordpress-zoom-integration/](https://elearningevolve.com/products/wordpress-zoom-integration/)

Zapier - Not sure if it will come down to this but I am familar with Zapier automations and have a paid account which could be used if automating membership inclusion between platforms becomes necessary

\----------

**Thought Process**

In an ideal world/the way I am currently going about this, there are three memberships, which will each include acess to their relevant content and (hopefully) live Zoom classes:

1. Kids - includes access to live kids classes and pre-recorded kids library videos
2. Adults - includes access to live adult classes and pre-recorded videos
3. All-Access - includes access to everything

There are 4 total teachers, who each have their own live Zoom class schedules.

Up until this point my idea was to use the Wordpress plugin, Ultimate Membership Pro, to restrict member-only website content to paid members, and to manage their access to specific pages containging the member content (Vimeo and Zoom), with free-trials/monthly subscription access.

My initial idea was to use that Zoom-Wordpress integration plugin to just display the classes on member-protected pages and show the calendar on an unprotected page so people can see what kind of classes are going on then they would have to become a member to access the page the classes are being streamed on.

Now that I am getting further into this, I am having a concern about management of registration for Zoom classes and class scheduling.

We have the membership management and restricted vimeo content access figured out.  The ultimate membership pro plugin manages the registration of members, restricts pages containing the member-only content to members, and processes monthly subscriptions using stripe integration.

I am trying to figure out if this approach is going to work for the live classes.

In my mind, the best way to help sell the memberships would be to make the live schedule front-facing to the public so potential users can see what the class lineup looks like but if we were to do that, I am not sure how to limit class participation to active/paid members.

Punchpass allows for schedule managemnent/class registration but I think it might be more complicated than it needs to be with users already having to have the membership in place then having to re-register on punchpass for the classes, but somehow doing that in a way that only gives them access to the classes relevant to the membership they paid for.

I'm not sure if Punchpass has a monthly membership option but even if it did, we would still have the issue of restricting recorded video content to paid members.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of my questions:**

Does anybody have any recommendations for how to go about showcasing the Zoom class schedule to the public but that somehow could restrict registration/participation to active members which are managed in a different location (wordpress/ultimate membership pro)?

Approaching it in this way, is it going to be possible to have the multiple membership levels or would it be significantly easier to just have 1 membership level that has access to everything?   This would then take away the consideration of correct classes being made available to the corresponding  membership levels/members.

Am I going about this the right way/is there a better way?

&amp;#x200B;

My clinic is using Zoom meetings to meet with clients.  When we create a meeting (whether on the Zoom web portal or the desktop app) we are able to ""Copy Invitation"" and paste the text into an email.  What it doesn't give us is the option for the receiver of that text to ""Add to Calendar.""

What we've noticed is that if we attend a Zoom Webinar or Create a Meeting with registration required,  the Zoom systems generated invitation has the ""Add to Calendar"" feature where the invited attendee can click it and it opens up their calendar and fills in the data to save.

Does anyone know of any way outside of the two options above that we can add this feature to the plain steps of creating a meeting and copying the invitation?

* It will hang it over the monitor which has a 1/4"" lip (pretty narrow)
* I want to use it up close when at my desk (Probably 18"" from screen/camera)
* I want to use it for my wife and I on Zoom happy hours so it will act as a ""meeting camera""

A cool feature would be to have a conversation attention focus feature where 2+ people (of let's say 10 ppl total) audio is slightly increased over the rest... it would like real life.. you can still hear all the convos and the others can hear you, but the people's audio of convo you're in at that moment is more distinguishable (increase volume or whatever).
You could also switch between focus if you over hear another chat you wanna chime in on.

I'm often in Zoom meetings with 50+ people, and sometimes want to see the person talking, let's call him PERSON A, while also seeing PERSON B and video of myself.

In gallery view, sometimes PERSON A and myself are on page 1, but person B is on page 2 or 3. I want those three windows all visible to me at the same time, with the ability to size them.

Is it possible to have the speaker take up the full screen, while pinning two other windows/people that can be resized and placed on top of the speaker's full screen window?

Right now, it seems that even in speaker mode, the 4 or 5 people who show up in the sidebar are toggled between whomever last spoke, but that isn't  helpful.

Now my professor is looking into that matter and is saying he'll track the IP of the one who sent that message and find him (yup, find me). 

I'm kinda freaked out that will he be able to track me down for sending that single message in the class chat. 

Can you guys help me out and let me know if that's possible or not that he'll trace my IP and find me? I was doing that on my phone by the way.

When I loaded the recording, I saw that the recording was of my coworker and of her boyfriend outside of hours. She (who is 57)  was doing a sexy dance and it was clear they were Zoom sexing and she had recorded it (i am guessing  on accident  cause she is bad  at computers and I am on the phone with her all day fixing IT problems for her). I stopped watching, went back to the admin account and deleted her recording and didn’t say anything to anyone (in retrospect maybe I should have?)

What is your policy about recording meetings? This was so awkward. I am thinking about sending a message to all staff and letting them know that “due to security concerns” we can no longer  record meetings and please do not use your company Zoom outside for personal calls.

I've noticed that when I go live on Facebook, which I do several times a week for work, the quality of the local recording drops from HD to way below modern SD quality (like 640x320). This is true even though the FB live video is 720p. When I don't go live, the quality of the local recording is great, or what passes for great in this kind of medium, anyway. FB live is DEFINITELY the factor affecting this change.

Why does the FB live stream cause Zoom to produce a lower quality local recording, lower even (by far) than the FB iive stream and Zoom real time broadcast itself?

Today, I CAN NOT MAKE IT DO THIS. Minimal mode insists on showing me only one face, apparently whoever's currently making most noise. How do I get it to show the rest of them? Often I care more about checking in on the people who are NOT talking than the one who currently is.

I'm teaching a fitness class over Zoom. I want to play songs from Spotify, but I also need my students to hear me through a wireless USB lav mic. I can do that by sharing my computer screen with audio: That way, they hear my Spotify AND my lav mic audio. 

**BUT** when I share my computer screen, the screen takes Spotlight. I'm testing it right now, and my friends tell me that even if I Spotlight my webcam, they're still seeing my computer desktop as the big window.

I've found one fix: If my students click ""Swap Shared Screen With Video"" in the upper right corner, this solves the problem. Unfortunately, I don't think I can ask all my clients to click that button. Some of them aren't technically adept, and some will be coming in from other platforms. 

Is there some way to automatically ""Swap Shared Screen with video?"" How do I share my screen but make my webcam the spotlight???

2020-04-15 07:09:23,Bose QC35II - Background static noise (Hands-Free AG...),"Hi everyone,

Like many these days, I started using Zoom for remote meetings. I use a Bose QC35II Bluetooth headset on a Windows 10 laptop.

I experience  background static whenever I have the following audio settings set in Zoom: 

Speaker: Headset (Bose QC35II Hands-Free AG..."")  
Microphone: Headset (Bose QC35II Hands-Free AG..."")

Now, if I set the Speaker settings to ""Headphones (Bose QC35II Stereo),"" the static is gone, however, I cannot hear the speaker.

Now, if I love the Speaker settings to HandsFree AG and change the Microphone settings to ""Microphone Array (Realtek Audio),"" the audio input (speaker) is free of static, but that means I am using the less than desirable laptop microphone.

Is this normal or am I doing something incorrectly?

Thank you! :)",1.0,1.0,NA,6.0,/r/Zoom/comments/g1g3h9/bose_qc35ii_background_static_noise_handsfree_ag/,Zen747

Greetings,

I'm hoping someone here will have some insight to the weird request headers I'm seeing from Fiddler4.

I occasionally see a request/response from random hosts like urqbcoyctigodhk that respond with a 301 to localhost. I'm wondering if anyone here has the expertise to let me know if this is normal or if I should be worried.

I'm thinking it may be zoom but I don't know.

Thank you.

2020-04-16 06:44:58,Anybody knows if a host can track an attendant activity?,"Today one of my teachers said during a class that we shouldn't try to copy in our exams as teachers have an attendant attention tracker that tells them if you opened something else, so he could download a file that would say what you opened and how much time you spent in that, and as an example he said that it would say: (Students name) Google Chrome 07:00 - 07:52, Word 07:34 - 07:42. 

Then he said that it could also tell them what you had open in your browser, so he could know if you searched for the answers.

As far as I know Zoom could just tell the host if you had it in focus or not, and they removed that feature 2 weeks ago so I think he was just bluffing hoping we would be too scared not to copy. I think that zoom allowing someone else to know what you did would be an invasion of your privacy .",1.0,2.0,NA,5.0,/r/Zoom/comments/g22lgq/anybody_knows_if_a_host_can_track_an_attendant/,OpeningTrain1

I have a licensed  account through my job and I've noticed that whenever I assign someone else as a host they somehow lose their hosting abilities when they (1) move to a breakout room and (2) I leave the session. #2 seems to happen randomly and not always.

2020-04-17 06:20:52,Becoming host without actual host giving it to you or leaving?,"This is a bug I think, but I want to know the exact reason of it if possible.

So, my school uses zoom (obv) for online classes. Today I invited a friend from another school to our online class with a pass. After like, I dunno, 20-25 seconds (?) of him getting in he got to be the host and my teacher was no longer the host.

The thing is, my teacher didn't transfer the host (and she didn't leave the meeting) and my friend wasn't even aware of it until I told him so he didn't take it on purpose.

My teacher could still screenshare and my friend had all host permissions he could even kick the teacher numerous times. 

We were both using phones with my friend, teacher was on pc.

2020-04-18 02:52:55,"Fast, easy to learn/improve, Zoom-friendly game? Seeking ideas and sharing a half-baked one.","I am trying to come up or find a game that I can play with people on Zoom that teaches the power of teamwork. There is an in-person game that does this very well that I'll describe in a moment, but none of the people I know who are familiar with this in-person game have been able to replicate anything like it on Zoom.

The in-person game goes like this. We hand 5-6 people a sack of toy balls, ranging from .75"" bouncy balls, Koosh balls, ping pong balls, squishy balls, you name it. Then they are asked to ""process"" as many balls as they can in 1 minute, per these rules:

* Each ball must have air-time.
* Each ball must be touched at least once by every team member.
* Balls cannot be passed to your direct neighbor to your immediate left or right.
* Each ball must return to the same person who introduced it into the system.
* A dropped ball cannot reenter play and does not count.

We do 5 rounds of this, allowing for 1 minute of strategy before each round.

What we typically find is that in the first round they might be able to pass 5-10 balls. By the end of round 5 they are typically able to pass 60-100.

What I love about this game is that it is face-paced, energetic, and shows a group of people that they can improve quickly just by talking to each other about how they work. For instance, you might ask them how much they think they might have have been able to process instead if they were given 10 minutes to play rather than 5 minutes to play and 5 minutes to plan. They never say that having twice the time would have produced equal or even better results. We can teach the rules of the game, play it, and debrief in 20-25 minutes.

The game I've come up with is this:

You are a group of wizards who are trying to build up as much magical power as you can before you cast a spell together. The best way to do this is to transfer increasingly complicated ""runes"" to one another through the magic Zoom portal.

The way that you do this is to take a piece of paper, draw a rune, indicate the who the next wizard is unambiguously on the paper, then hold it up to the Zoom portal for them to see. They acknowledge it and draw that same rune and transfer it to the next wizard until every wizard has received the rune.

The first rune must be drawn with one straight line, the second with two, the third with three, and so on and so forth. All lines in the rune must touch. A example of progressing runes are a line, V, triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon.

For instance, maybe you have four wizards: Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave. Alice would draw a line above the name Bob. Bob would draw a line above the name Charlie... Charlie to Dave, and Dave back to Alice. Now Alice draws a V above Bob's name and Bob continues the cycle.

At the end of the round, you are encouraged to cast the spell by standing up and moving to shake out some of that excess magical energy for a few seconds with your team.

I've never tried this and have no idea how well it'd work, but it seems fast-paced, easy to learn, easy to improve in (e.g., they may quickly discover that they don't need to write someone's whole name, just their initials. Or maybe the ""runes"" get simpler from hexagons to six overlapping lines. What I don't like about this game is that it will probably require a fair amount of paper and it may be hard to see pen drawings on the camera.

2020-04-18 23:17:36,"'Low resources' error during meetings on Windows 10 PC, accompanied by choppy audio. Is there any way to fix this?","Hi everyone,

I'm running the most recent version of the Zoom app on my Windows 10 PC, which is slightly old, but still perfectly serviceable for everything else I do, however Zoom is proving to be quite the resource hog. I keep getting a 'Low resources' error, accompanied by choppy audio, not long after entering a meeting, even when I've ensured nothing is running in the background, something I've double-checked via Task Manager just in case I'd overlooked something. It's disruptive enough that I've begun just switching to using Zoom via my Android phone instead, but in doing so, I obviously lose some features of the desktop application, not to mention I need to make sure I have my Bluetooth keyboard &amp; phone stand handy. There's got to be an easier way, surely! Are there any ways to improve my experience, or should I just give up on even trying to use my PC, &amp; just use my phone all the time?

For reference, I'm using a Dell Venue 11 Pro 7300, with 8 GB RAM, &amp; an Intel® Core™ i5-4300Y CPU @ 1.60GHz, running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit. Granted, it's an older computer, but seriously... this shouldn't be out of the realm of possibility, in terms of being able to run a program  I've never encountered such difficulties with anything else I do on it. If I didn't have to use Zoom for some interactions right now, &amp; if the decision on what platform to use was up to me, I would've given up on Zoom already, due to this, &amp; of course the privacy issues.

Anyone else got this problem too, or can anyone offer some advice about this? Thanks in advance for your assistance.

I have been trying to get through to Zoom support for 4 days without any luck thus far.  I have an upcoming Zoom meeting scheduled that I want to turn into a Zoom webinar.  Usually there is a link at the bottom of the details page that says ""convert meeting into a webinar"" which I have successfully done prior with other meetings.  However this specific meeting isn't giving this link option.  Does anyone know of another way to covert this meeting?

I cannot figure out why this happens. Today I was attempting to Zoom with cousins. Same thing. Eventually I was able to join the meeting by using a link. Magically, the password was correct even though it was the same damn password I'd entered correctly 80 times before.

Does anyone have any ideas I could pass to the teacher to check on this?  The single teacher is adamant that it's us and our machine.

Prior to the social distancing measures being put in place, myself and a few other colleagues were volunteering at a cultural community centre to tutor elementary and high school kids. It would run like a study session, where kids would do their work and ask us tutors questions when they had any, at which one of us would go and help them. 

We just started our first trial run on zoom today, and I have one question: Is it possible to have communication flow only between two people, without interrupting others?

Example: student 1 has a question, which tutor 1 can answer. student 1 mutes all people except for tutor 1, and tutor 1 mutes all people except for student 1. The rest of the session can go on as normal.

Can someone let me know if this is possible, or if we will have to resort to having multiple zoom session. (1 per tutor)?

2020-04-22 06:51:14,No Record or Reaction Buttons on Chromebook,"I have a sneaking suspicion I'm missing something ridiculously obvious here:  
I'm trying to archive some chats coming up, but for some reason there's no option for me to record. The buttons just...aren't there. Other people on the same chat have the option, even when I'm hosting.  

The only thing I can find on the help site is essentially ""There is a record button on Zoom. Zoom allows you to record things. The record button looks like this. Have fun recording Zoom using your Zoom record button!""

Anyone got any ideas?

2020-04-23 04:20:36,(while screensharing) PPT slides super blurry / unreadable,"All participants of my Zoom meeting complained the POWERPOINT slides I  was SCREENSHARING were completely BLURRY to the point that they were pretty much UNREADABLE. 

I somehow don’t think it’s due to a bad internet connection (my speed is around 100 Mbit), as my video feed is crisp and  like super sharp all the time. Sound is also okay and without delay. 

 Funny thing is… like when I start screensharing a PPT slide, first 10  seconds it seems to be okay, then it gets real bad real quick. And then, after like 20 seconds no one can read/see anything at all. 

Thoughts:   
 (1) maybe this is due to an unstable internet connection? (argument against that: Stable video &amp; audio feed)  
  (2) Screen resolution issues? I’m using Windows 7 and the “recommended”  screen resolution of 1366 x 768. If it’s a screen resolution issue, how  can I fix that?   
 (3) maybe it’s a different issue altogether?

2020-04-23 04:58:51,Remove audio clipping,"I'm using the 'pro' version of Zoom to record video podcasts remotely. When one person talks and then another person talks over them, you then don't hear both well. From my end, if someone is talking and then I start talking, it cuts out the other person's audio and I only hear me. Even if they're talking and I'm just laughing or even clapping this happens. This happens both ways.

This is a problem A) because it's an unscripted podcast and if we can't hear each other, then it defeats the point. And B) the recording from Zoom after the meeting reflects this cutting out audio as well so not even the audience can hear what was being said in those moments.

I just want it to sound and record basically like a phone call. On a phone call, you can still hear the other person even if you're talking over them and vice versa. What we need is for whatever each participant says to come through un-affected no matter what sound is coming through from the other end. 

I've experimented with me and other participants using the advanced audio settings to turn on original sound, turn off suppress background noise, etc. but it hasnt solved it.

I would've thought this would be a common question but I can't find anyone else talking about it.

Any tips are appreciated thanks \~",1.0,1.0,NA,10.0,/r/Zoom/comments/g69ahr/remove_audio_clipping/,CEOofBetDSI

I want to have one of my own with multiple DJs.  I have most of the functionality figured out, but there are a few things I could not find in the knowledge base.  

The first is how to set all the participants videos on an ""auto cycle"".  For instance, if I (the host) don't have any particular video on Spotlight, I would like it to rotate through the participants.  Does it do this by default?  I am not sure.

The second question is whether or not I can do a transparent overlay using the desktop program over the main broadcast.  This would be a static png with transparency that is on the main Host's broadcast.

2020-04-23 10:05:10,"2 person call, how to share screens so we can each see each other's screen?","I do 1 on 1 calls on Zoom a lot, where often we'll want to look at each other's screens. I cannot for the life of me figure out a way for both of us to see the other's screen simultaneously. On other video call software this is a no-brainer; I hit share, the other person hits share, and we're both seeing each other's screens.

On Zoom, I've enabled the ""multiple participants can share simultaneously"" option. I have also enabled the option ""Show Zoom windows during screen share"". When I share my screen, my Zoom window disappears (what's that show zoom windows option do then?) and the other person sees my screen. Then, when the other person shares their screen, nothing on my end changes at all. My Zoom window is still gone, and neither of us can see the other's screen. If I stop sharing mine, now I can see theirs. But while we're both sharing neither of us can see the other's.

Same thing happens if they share first. When they start sharing, I can see their screen. Then I share mine, my Zoom window disappears (even though I've enabled ""show zoom windows during screen share"") and I can't see their screen until I stop sharing mine.

Why is this so difficult for something that should be a basic feature? It's very common that my clients and I will want to see each other's screens at once, and it's very unprofessional/distracting to keep having to go ""ok, you stop sharing. ok, let me screenshot that. ok let me start sharing"". It's a waste of time when we could just get to our work.

What's the solution to this other than just use Hangouts? That's what I've been doing to avoid having to keep telling each other when to start and stop sharing.",1.0,1.0,NA,14.0,/r/Zoom/comments/g6eavq/2_person_call_how_to_share_screens_so_we_can_each/,nappiestapparatus

But then I asked the people in my session who have virtual backgrounds and most people had not created an account and were not setting backgrounds through their own camera software, but were still able to set virtual backgrounds in Zoom's program.

Second bug:

Some people are having problems joining passworded meetings, even when the password is entered correctly. Not sure what causes this!

Third bug:

Some people are not able to annotate the screen as a participant, while others can. One who couldn't do it was using an HP DV6 running Windows 7. I'm not sure what the other people who had this problem were running, most likely a regular laptop (not Chromebook).

1. I (licensed user) created a schedule for our institution with several concurrent meetings at various days during the week.

2. We purchased additional licensed accounts for the max number of concurrent meetings (in this case 4).

3. I added the additional accounts as alternative hosts (who, from what I understand, are able to start/host the meeting instead of the meeting creator) to ALL of the meetings created by me.

4. All alternative hosts are logged properly (on desktop).

5. All alternative hosts attempt to start their meeting with the link provided in the Zoom email they get (which is simply /s/MEETINGID)

*We need to have one person (me) create the meeting schedule without the alternate hosts having control over the schedule. We also need to be able to shuffle which alternate host takes which meeting.

Last week we had one occasion with 3 concurrent meetings - everything worked fine. 2 of the alternative hosts were logged in computers on location in our office, 1 was hosting remotely from their house. No problem.

Since yesterday, this setup does not work anymore.

1. Alternative host 1 starts meeting 1 (created by me, manager)
2. Alternative host 2 CANNOT start meeting 2 (created by me, manager) and says Alternative host 2 is already in a meeting; ending that meeting ends meeting 1.
3. Same for Alternative host 3.

The only work around is to give scheduling rights to all alternative hosts (which we do NOT want to do), then have that alternative host claim ownership of the meeting (which also removes it from the schedule of the manager, me - again, something we don't want to have happen). Then after the meetings are over, manually give ownership back to me.

Father is adamant that the issue is with Zoom or the teacher, but I believe that can be ruled out since no other student is having the same problem.

The device can be ruled out as a problem since connection with other classes is fine.

My thought is the hotspot. They are currently using a Sprint MiFi unlimited plan. After some quick research I found that Sprint deprioritizes connections after they've used 50gb in a billing cycle. I am assuming the 8:30am time is a busy network for the tower.

Any other potential ideas what it could be?",1.0,1.0,NA,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/g6mjs9/zoom_troubleshooting_help/,wave221
2020-04-23 21:34:27,Best video conference software for my needs?,"Im a musical director for a church, about 40 congregants on average.  They have specific (unrealistic)  demands.    What I'm hoping for is a conferencing software that will NOT have the audio bounce around according to who is loudest.   The congregation insists on all singing along (not just at home, but audible).   But, since theres 20+ devices, the audio is picking up one person strongest, then another.   If there was a video conference software that would allow for everyone to be balanced that would be great.    Though what would be even MORE ideal would be if I could be something like 50% of the total volume, and then everyone else be balanced with each other.

I'm talking about using Zoom's chat function to send individual messages, text messaging someone else, or even emailing them all while everyone else continues with the meeting unaware of what's going on beneath the surface.  Maybe you're saying ""WTF???"" to your work buddy about something the boss is talking about, making fun of Ted in Accounting, or flirting with your workplace crush. Whatever it is, I want to hear about it. I hope to write a fun, anecdote-filled story about how people are making do during these trying time. And of course, I will grant you anonymity if you need it to protect your job!

There’s no mention of any current iPad models, but that 7th generation 10.2” uses the Apple A10 and M10 chips and the iPad Mini 5 has the newer Apple A12 and M12 chips. I’d think that would work for virtual backgrounds, but Zoom aren’t confirming.

Ever since, I can't even hear from it properly. I figured out it was the the ""Droid"" mechanical voice filter that I didn't even set it to. But I can't make sense of what they are saying. Like delay + robotic vocie makes everything so bad. It creeped me the hell out at first. IV Cam you have to pay for, which now doesn't seem like a bad idea because I rather not buy a new webcam.

**TL:DR:** What are the best ways to use Galaxy S10 as a webcam to connect to the computer? Wireless would be ideal, but whatever works. I have a desktop with no wifi. Starting to feel desperate at this point.

2020-04-28 01:04:08,Our 4 y/o aka Cock,"This happened a couple weeks abut I’m still cracking up about it so thought I’d share...maybe you’ll get a chuckle out of it too. 
My 4-year-old has *really* gotten in to pretending she’s a dog lately. Normally she’ll pretend to be a dog one day, a mermaid the next, then a firefighter...you get it. Anyway, she’s been stuck on being a dog for weeks. She’s named herself “Cock-a-doodle-doo” and insists I get in on the game and call her “Cock-a-doodle-doo” too. I call “Cock-a-doodle-doo” to come to dinner, “Cock-a-doodle-doo” to come get in the bath, “Cock-a-doodle-doo”, to come help clean toys, etc. 
On a related note, my husband has been working from home right in the middle of our house in the living room. My daughter and I typically do a pretty good job of being quiet when he’s on Zoom/conference call with one big, recent exception. 
The other day, our beloved “Cock-a-doodle-doo” decided she wanted to start going by a nickname. She told me what it was but since we were trying to be as quiet as we could, I didn’t quite catch what she said. She said it again and I still didn’t hear/understand her. She got really frustrated at this point and started yelling her desired nickname over and over (in the background of the Zoom call). “COCK!!! COCK!! MY NAME IS COCK!! MY NAME IS COOOOOOOCK!!” Husband on his Zoom call tried to keep it together but just plain couldn’t pretty soon his boss and the owner of the company and most of his coworkers were dying laughing at our four year old named Cock. Hope you might get #quarantinelife chuckle out of it too. 
PS- I asked her this morning again what her name was (wondering if she might have moved on at some point) but nope, still Cock.",1.0,6.0,NA,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/g94p5a/our_4_yo_aka_cock/,shimmyboomerang

When using my Airpods with zoom, they are super buggy and do not work correctly. Anyone else having similar issues? I looked online but am not finding anything recently. 

**The issue(s):** 

When I join a zoom call with airpods already in (and have been previously working for playing spotify on my computer, etc), they won't connect OR they will attempt to connect and cause the zoom to slow down a lot and usually end up crashing. If I try and manually click into the different audio settings and connect the airpods there, my microphone errors and it won't work either. When I am trying to troubleshoot, I can't get any audio so I am often missing the beginning of meetings. 

If I am in the zoom meeting BEFORE I connect my airpods, i can *sometimes* add them while in the zoom meeting and they will work. But it is not a consistent experience. 

Like many folks right now, I am working remotely in a house full of people and this is super frustrating! It usually ends with me scrambling to get to a room with a closed door.

2020-04-29 02:18:07,Local Recording Silently Disabled," Over the weekend, Zoom for some reason DISABLED local recording as default. If you had things set to record locally automatically, they will not record at all now. THERE WAS NO NOTICE IN OR OUT OF THE APP. This cannot be fixed in the app itself.

Remote recording is functional but will not automatically start if you made your meeting with recording set to Local.

To fix this, you need to log into the Zoom WEBSITE, go to settings-&gt;recordings and enable local record, then restart zoom. Then check every meeting and make sure the option for local recording is set  under advanced options.

This is unacceptable. First, silent changes like this should never happen. A bunch of people are now in big trouble with bosses for not recording things that needed to be recorded because they were supposed to automatically record and didn't. 

Second, the options shouldn't be spread across multiple platforms with mutually exclusive options. I should NEVER have to use a specific platform to access an option. If I am on my phone and need to change something, it should be in the phone options. I shouldn't have to go to the website to change options on my PC app. Every platform on which the app runs should have total and equal access to all options and controls.",1.0,1.0,NA,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/g9sfaw/local_recording_silently_disabled/,void2258

2020-04-29 02:38:24,Another Virtual Background Help Post,"Hey guys!

I have been trouble getting a virtual background on my MacBook Pro!

I have been trying to get it to work for weeks but with no luck, and I'm pretty jealous when my friends are all able to do it and I'm the only one we can't.

I'm running version macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 and I have an Intel Core of i5 (I realize from a lot of sources that this may be the problem but I would love to get your guy's opinion as well)

Please let me know if there is any way I can get a virtual background or not. 

Thanks guys!(:",1.0,1.0,NA,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/g9st3p/another_virtual_background_help_post/,shaybloom

2020-04-29 06:15:21,[IMPORTANT] If you get a large meeting licence you need to activate it before using it!!,"I purchased yesterday a large meeting to host more than 100 people and today I realised on the meeting that I could only host 100 people. As annoyed as I was, I had a workaround with another friend's Zoom account and our meeting ran perfectly.

After going to my Zoom profile I could see that my limit was 100 people. After asking the boot, it told me that I needed to go to: https://zoom.us/account/user#, select my user, click in ""Feature"" and add the large meeting to myself.

Now I can host up to 500 people, but I can see people jumping this step and getting frustrated with it (as I was).

Hope it could help you avoiding some headaches.",1.0,1.0,NA,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/g9wxad/important_if_you_get_a_large_meeting_licence_you/,RulerD
2020-04-29 06:15:51,Issue with converting a local stored recorded file.,"So I am having a weird issue with zoom recording. Normal after I do a zoom lecture the file is converted. I had a case where I had two zoom lectures back to back and so when the second one tried to convert it didn't work and left a folder that looks like this.

At first when I tried to double click it asked me what I wanted to use to open them. Nothing seemed to work and after a lot of google searching. I found I needed the  zTscoder and that is why they look like zoom files. 

When I do the conversion I get this message

I have tried to rename the files to those above but have had no luck, I still get the same error. I read online that if the folders name they are in is too large this can also be an issue so I shrunk that down but also no luck.   
If anyone has any advice or help I would greatly appreciate it. Zoom support has been non existent.",1.0,1.0,NA,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/g9wxl1/issue_with_converting_a_local_stored_recorded_file/,Jcc84

We are talking about setting up a breakout room for people to pop into to get help (it's teaching PowerBI and it's hands on lab exercises). I have been reading about breakout sessions on Zoom's website, but I am not the license holder and can't just set one up and play.

Can you have a breakout room with screen sharing enabled or allowed. Does our idea of a help room where participants can share their screen with a panelist or host for help sound feasible?

So...I have 4 questions related to this if that's okay:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What would happen if I clicked on those scheduled meetings? 
2. Do I need to do anything prior to these video chats other than just log into my Zoom account and be ready a minute or two prior to our schedule video chat?

2020-04-30 01:27:53,Breakout Rooms - Ability for Guests to change rooms.,"I hosted a birthday party happy hour and thought it would be great to design a virtual establishment. I named the breakout rooms PATIO, BACK BAR, MUSIC LOUNGE.  The patio was to be the default room that my guests would be assigned to. I had a 'bartender' person hosting the Back Bar and a local event DJ friend play music and videos in the Music Lounge (via his equipment and OBS streaming software to share his screen.   


Everything was set up.. and I thought I tested it the night before.  My hope was guests could wander from room to room. This allowed chat and music to not conflict and separate guests into smaller groups. Problem is that guests cannot see the Breakout rooms icon on the bottom of their screen.  In test i discovered that you may need to make guests into ""Cohosts"" to be able to see the option to move rooms. Unfortunately at the event.. I also discovered that you cannot make guests cohosts while the room sessions are happening.  It was a great event and people loved it... i literally had to tell people to message me via chat if they wanted me to put them in other rooms.  It was fun ""banishing"" people to rooms.. but i wish zoom would make room mobility an option, the possibilities are great...so guests can experience virtual room events or different vendors or representatives in each room for clients..  the ideas go on..  thoughts?",1.0,1.0,NA,8.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gadldn/breakout_rooms_ability_for_guests_to_change_rooms/,OchoZeroCinco

2020-05-01 09:49:44,Issues with Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd Gen as Input,"Hey all. I'm taking vocal lessons through Zoom and I just got my first audio interface for singing, the Solo. So I heard myself in the mic through the interface monitor, and heard the computer audio, and thought all was well, but my instructor couldn't hear me. So we rescheduled the meeting. On top of this, the default mic seems to want to hide now, and switching to it in Zoom doesn't do crap.

Has anyone else had this issue? I've checked around for solutions and saw one guy loop his audio through Ableton, which I tried but no luck. I'm on PC and it seems like there are limitations with manipulating audio or something.

Anyway, any advice on how to fix this is very much welcome. Thanks!",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gb98et/issues_with_focusrite_scarlett_solo_3rd_gen_as/,Calligraphiti

My initial thought was to dial in to the call from a second source (my phone) with the video set as a virtual background. Unfortunately, my phone can't play video virtual backgrounds, and I need to use my computer for the primary screen.

I looked up dual monitors, but screen-sharing in any way would mean interrupting the chat. I would like it to just play unobtrusively on a loop on a separate feed in the Gallery view.

Any thoughts on how best to accomplish this?

When I’m in a Zoom meeting, my video feed (showing myself) works fine for a few minutes. Then it freezes. 
If I turn the video feed off, and then back on, it works again — for about 30 seconds, at which time it freezes.
If I ignore the fact that the video feed is frozen, eventually the video of ‘me’ is just a black screen.

For example, in a speech contest, I've heard it advised for everyone to turn off their video except for the speaker so that there isn't as much load, risking the speaker or the judges having connection issues.

But from what I'm reading on here, Zoom only sends what is being viewed, so if everyone is just watching one speaker in Speaker view (vs Gallery view) there is no difference whether they have their video turned on or off. It might create lag for the spectator since their uploading video as well as streaming video, maybe, though? But the speaker has to do that anyway, and the judges have their videos off for anonymity anyway, so that shouldn't be a concern. 

Could someone elaborate on this subject more? Is there anything in the offical docs that cover this?

I am having a severe issue whereby whenever Zoom tries to render transparency(most notably on the entire screen during annotation), it just renders as black

Similar, less notable issues whereby if I share something which is partially obscured it just transmits a black square

I'm not sure if this is LXQt optimizations or Linux in general(As I have seen similar issues when running programs in WINE,  it might mean that Zoom just havent made a proper Linux package yet)

As soon as I do, i lose the view of my participants and can only see the screen I am sharing. This makes it almost impossible to teach as I work with children who are either non verbal, or who are limited verbally. All of them have behaviours as well, so it is essential that I can see if they are engaged if I am reading a story off the computer for example.

I have tried everything but can not seem to get the view of them to appear when I share. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? It is making it so hard to teach and is putting a lot of extra work on my colleagues who I teach with as I am not able to do this part so they have to do it all.

2020-05-07 05:08:41,Downtuning on zoom?,"Hi everyone,

My partner and I are both opera singers. We are attending online summer programs on Zoom and will sing for agents and experts in the field through Zoom. We are having an issue when using my Bluebird mic.

When we use my Bluebird mic, plugged into a VTB-1 preamp and Avid mbox mini interface, the audio sometimes gets downtuned by a half step. I have attached a recording of our zoom meeting where we tested audio. You can hear the downtuned singing at 3:27. 

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/zp31m59zj2qwypm/Downtuned%20audio.m4a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zp31m59zj2qwypm/Downtuned%20audio.m4a?dl=0)

When we use my partner's Blue Yeti mic, which is a usb mic, there is no downtuning. You can hear Blue Yeti audio at 7:20.

As you can tell, the Bluebird mic's audio is a half step down, her first vocal note being a G#, and in the Blue Yeti an A natural.

We unplugged the Bluebird and plugged it back in and that fixed the problem for a bit, but then we unplugged and plugged back in again and it downtuned again. We tried inserting the mbox mini in different usb ports on her computer, but the downtuning still seems to be a totally random occurrence.

I've used my bluebird mic for years recording on Garageband and Logic X and I've never experienced downtuning before. I will try recording on Garageband with it again tonight but doubt it is a problem with my mic.

Is this downtuning a problem with zoom? Could it be the preamp or interface? The Bluebird is a better quality mic so we want to use it for the zoom meetings where we sing for people, but we are just worried that we will sound downtuned to them and not know it. These are people who have never heard our voices before, so they may not necessarily be able to tell that it is not our natural voice.

2) Even though ""Virtual Backgrounds"" is togged ON for my account in the web portal, I still do not see the Virtual Backgrounds tab in the app which would allow me to enable it for the meeting.

4) I do not see any options on the Breakout Rooms tab; i.e. to send people there automatically or to adjust the 60 second timer.

Basically, I was in a Zoom meeting university lecture and had an offensive name by mistake (because I was on a Zoom call earlier with my friends and had forgotten to change it). So upon realizing this I immediately left, changed my name and returned. Then at the end of the meeting the lecturers said someone had used an offensive name and they were going to have a look into it.

This is a problem for me because Zoom does not allow most users to disable US servers (other data centres can be switched off).

2020-05-09 00:45:29,Unable to Spotlight myself,"I am teaching online and for the first few weeks I was teaching, I and my co-teacher were using multiple devices, including dual-log in on her phone and Surface, and I on my laptop, in order to move between different views for the lessons we were teaching. I was able to swap Spotlight between her two devices and my laptop, and even the students as needed, no problem. It was a seamless way to move between views of the subject matter, and was perfect for our needs.

We pared it down to two devices recently, and I upgraded my laptop, and now suddenly I can't Spotlight myself. I can Spotlight anyone else, but I can't Spotlight me. She can still Spotlight everyone just fine--including herself--if she has hosting permissions. If I log in on my phone, I can still Spotlight everyone, including myself. Just not on my laptop app. When I click on myself on my laptop, all I can see is an option to rename myself or edit my profile picture. It's a 2018 Mac running Catalina and the latest version of Zoom.

I have tried every search term I can think of to find what this problem is and can't find anyone else reporting this. I have issued a ticket about it and no response. The only options I have had thus far is giving hosting capabilities to someone else and having to ask them to Spotlight me when I want my video Spotlighted, which isn't exactly the smoothest thing when I know how I want a given lecture ""choreographed"" between different views.   


I can't imagine this is an issue with the laptop or the latest updates to Zoom or else it would be widely reported, but nor can I see anything in settings that could be toggled on my end which would disable the ability to Spotlight oneself. I'm the host--essentially the ""god of the meeting"" who should have control of the views.

A few weeks ago I used zoom to share my screen with someone as we played an adventure game. (Grim Fandango! Purchased and installed on GOG.com) We got the call going, I opened the game, and then shared my screen to that game. We proceeded to play a few hours, hearing each other but watching the same screen.

We tried again today, and every time I went to share the screen with the game, it appeared to work, but then when I clicked back to the game, the screen flashed black for a moment and then the person on the other end could only see whatever was on the screen before it flashed black. She could hear the game but not see any movement.

Either the screen share function changed in the meantime, or maybe Zoom is preventing apps that might infringe copyright?

Hi, I just got the AT2020 Audio Technica cardioid condenser pluged into a Scarlet 4i4 3rd gen audio interface.  
I have on a regular basis online music class and I was hoping that this setup will do the job.  
Unfortunatly, When I use the mic with zoom, there's a weird cliping noise and I canot use it.  
I tried deactevating the two first audio processing setting and the Echo removal to automatic but did'nt worked.  
The Scarlet 4i4 is set to 48000 sample rate and 512 buffer siz. Clock source is internal and clock Status is Locked.  
Maybe the internet ?

I tried this setup with messenger, skype and reaper and it works really great. 

Why not doing the class with messenger or skype ? Well because there are noise reducer and stuff incrypted in these program that you can't remove and it sounds super compressed.

anywais, If you guys and girls know anything about that kind of problem, plz let me know :)

PS, I have recordings that shows the cliping glitch if you need to hear it.

2020-05-11 12:36:12,Using Google account to join Zoom on Chromebook,"When I get to the meeting the images of me are what the camera sees as my ugly face and the other is the avatar I use with Google account. There are 7 participants, including myself, in total. However, Zoom counts me and the avatar as separate entities, so it adds 1 to the 7 showing now 8 in the meeting.

When I am at the meeting and I am speaking, there is a bit of feedback and also a pretty bad echo. I am assuming Zoom is thinking my avatar and I are 2 separate things and the audio does not know what to do.

I was able to reduce feedback by lowering the volume that comes from the Chromebook speakers.

Could the echo come from the ""me"" and the avatar being considered as 2 separate things by Zoom?

If not, is there a secret setting that says don't create an echo? If so, where is it?

Perhaps it is because I am using a Chromebook, and there are settings the others have, like adding a background image, that I cannot find anywhere.

I have figured out I cannot use the full screen for the meeting. When it is full screen there is no way to see settings. The minimum sized screen gives me options when I mouse over the bottom of the Zoom window. But none of the options seem to provide the background. It does have an audio icon but that seems to just turn the microphone on or off.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/Zoom/comments/ghguyy/using_google_account_to_join_zoom_on_chromebook/,kojak343

I have a friend with some Zoom (corporate) training coming up and someone suggested that they have a dual monitor setup to have the presentation on one monitor and the presentation powerpoint on the other.  

Is that really ever necessary?  I have seen it where you can just shrink the video chat portion and still allow you to see what's being presented.  

Would a dual monitor really ever be necessary as an attendee? I can understand as a present, but that isn't the case here. Are we missing something?  I'm just trying to save them unnecessary hassle.

2020-05-14 00:21:43,Zoom host internet connection causes issues for whole meeting?,"Hello!

If the Zoom host's internet connection is poor, slow, or unstable, does it cause issues for the Zoom meeting as a whole? 

All my college courses have moved to online lectures via Zoom starting in March. Summer courses just started and today was the first time we had an online meeting with this particular professor. We've never experienced problems with any other class meeting with other professors so I'm wondering if maybe the issue is being caused by this professor's (Zoom host) internet connection? 

There were only 33 participants in the room and we were instructed at the beginning of the meeting to not use our video option to share our pretty faces with each other. We experienced extremely choppy audio that was made worse when the professor shared her screen. All of the students were experiencing the same issue so I know that it's not my internet connection that is the issue. 

Any insight would be extremely helpful!",1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gj286m/zoom_host_internet_connection_causes_issues_for/,ThatLishBitsh

I'm using a mic/headphone Y adapter between the mic and the iPad and have the audio outputting from a bluetooth speaker.

Have tested the mic in a normal phone call so I know the mic/adapter are not faulty. I also read that you need to have the mic plugged in before you open zoom but that hasn't worked either.

2020-05-14 14:04:50,Zoom Room Doom - A Question for the Zoom Experts Out There,"TL;DR: I would LOVE some advice. My Very Large Zoom Meeting started requiring a password after admitting about 30 people. Do you think it's because I tried enabling the Waiting Room after the meeting started? Or is Zoom just trying to hurt my reputation?

Hey everyone. I run the Zoom account for my department. Today we held a BIGGGGG meeting. The waiting room was NOT enabled by the colleague who first setup the meeting but it was \*supposed\* to be. Once the meeting began, I as the host realized this error and went into the Meeting Settings on the Zoom website and 'Enabled Waiting Room' --- while the meeting was open, with about 30 participants having already entered. Then, I think once I had enabled the waiting room feature, the room started requiring a password from all of the participants still wanting to join (100+ people). But the first 30 people to join didn't need a password because the link was embedded with the password.

This led to CHAOS. Nobody had been given a password. Because the password was embedded in the Zoom link. This wasn't supposed to happen!!! Let me tell you, I did not feel or look good when this went down - in front of 100+ people I work for.. mortification doesn't begin to describe it.

Can anyone explain how this happened? I would LOVE some advice from those who understand how this happened... PS there was an offer to update the Zoom software; I as the Host did not do so, but I am sure many of the users had.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gjgj9n/zoom_room_doom_a_question_for_the_zoom_experts/,ilovebromeliads

Here are my thoughts, as I was asked to help put this together.

Speeches: Pre recotd as much as possible. 

Announcing Students : Yeabook company will be providing image with student photo /certificate for each student. The plan was to have teachers pre-record *calling up student"", and combine the two in premiere pro to create a video clip for each student. 

- Create video for each class (3 total), of names being called that plays to simulate having their name called to receive certificates. 

The timeline 

- Loop video of moments from school year ( being created by others), to welcome guest, once accepted into meeting. 

- Add clips with speeches before, and between videos of classes being recognized. 

- Group live singing of school song to end ceremony. 

- Maybe doing post ceremony breakout rooms by class, so they can hang out with friends and teachers after. 

THOUGHTS? 

Pitfalls / Issues / What else should I be addressing?

When I join a meeting with my two accounts, the profile picture shows up, but in my contacts list it just shows the initials. Does anyone know why this is and how it works?

Also, I know there’s a setting for “hide participant profile pictures in a meeting,” but I don’t have that turned on, and even so, some people’s do work just fine, but others don’t, and it’s weird.

EDIT: might it possibly have something to do with Google account setup? My secondary account is set up through Google and I *think* (although I don’t remember for sure) that when I created it, it automatically took the profile picture from the associated Google account. I just went into my Zoom settings and manually reuploaded the same photo and it instantly updated it in my contacts on my main account. I don’t know though, our school accounts are through Google but I doubt most people (whose pictures are usually fine) would’ve gone in and uploaded the photo a second time, and even so, I’m still not sure what that’d have to do with anything.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gjs6my/why_do_profile_pictures_show_up_sometimes_but_not/,xKnightLite

Her laptop's built-in microphone is perfectly fine. I went to sound settings, and the microphone is picking up noise just fine.

Zoom itself is NOT picking up any noise. If you go into the app's audio settings, the ""Input Level"" under ""Microphone"" is not registering any sound at all. I tried both microphone options: ""Same as System"" and the ""Microphone (Realtek(R) Audio)"", which I believe were both the same thing anyway, and I still could not get any audio input.

As a last resort I uninstalled and reinstalled the program. It made no difference.

2020-05-18 07:56:07,"Allowing non-Owner Admins/Hosts Control over Starting Meetings, Muting, Screen Sharing, Security in general, etc","Long story short, I'm working with 3 others on setting up a regular meeting of sorts. One friend, Matt, is the Pro account holder and thus the ""Owner"", as Zoom calls it. He also added us to his account (our user accounts are connected to his) AND he gave Admin status to my friend Beth and I.

We want to be able to run meetings so that Beth and I have the same Security privileges that Matt does during the meeting. During a test run, I was able to share my screen, but I had no control of things like admitting participants, stopping screen sharing, or muting people. 

We tried it so that Matt signed in as a Guest instead and I was the only Host, but even still, I had no control over Security/Participants, etc, even though I was set as an account Admin.

Since the type of meetings we are holding are somewhat open to the public by necessity/tradition, we want to be able to let new people come in, BUT we also want it so that Beth and I can run meetings, control security, mute people, etc without Matt if necessary.

He, Beth, and I were under the impression that connecting our accounts to his and being designated as Admins and Hosts would give us this ability. Furthermore, we would like to allow ALL 3 of us to have these abilities *while all logged into the same meeting*. 

The Pro Account description for ""User Management"" says this:

""User management allows account Owners and Admins to manage their users, such as add, delete and assign roles and add-on features.""

Are we misunderstanding how it works? It seems to imply that an account's Admins have more control than normal, but we have not seen how to put that in effect.

Unfortunately, although Matt is the account Owner, he may be the least tech-savvy one of us, so that's why I'm asking here. I couldn't find a similar topic by searching here and the Zoom official FAQ doesn't have anything this specific.

I have a client trying to use virtual backgrounds for an online performance she's creating. Her laptop should be well within the requirements to make it work with a Core i5 7200U, 8GB Ram, Win 10 64bit, and a Intel HD Graphics 620/Nvidia Geforce 950M.  

However from my research there seems to be a compatibility problem between the HD 620 and Zoom, with no fix in sight.    
Two questions:   

Do you have any trick  how to get the Intel Graphics to play along with Zoom?  

or  

Can I force Zoom to utilise the 950M instead?   

&amp;#x200B;

I've updated all the drivers and tried to force Zoom to use the dedicated GPU in the Nvidia control centre. Neither seems to have an effect. She is already using a green screen and a proper lighting setup but is still experiencing fringing and the occasional complete drop of the background.

2020-05-18 23:25:00,Can't get meeting ID to expire,"Hi,

received few hours ago an email from Zoom that someone (name never heard) is waiting for a host (me) to start the meeting. Legit email from Zoom but the weird thing is that the one-time meeting was already held over than a month ago and ended by the host in the end. Meeting ID was generated through Outlook and it didn't have a password. 

How come that the meeting ID is still valid for the same meeting? When accessing the meeting, the host and subject of the meeting is visible and matches. What could be done to disable the meeting ID and to end meetings properly when the meeting has actually ended? I think it's a bit weird.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gm3hlb/cant_get_meeting_id_to_expire/,luserfame
2020-05-18 23:43:07,Zoom Desktop Client... broken?,"So I've got a Pro license and have been using Zoom for meetings with my buddies for about a month.  Last night my computer wanted to restart for updates and I hit yes, but did not notice that I was still connected to Zoom via the desktop client when the restart happened.

Once the computer restarted, my Zoom Meetings application is broken.  If I click on Settings, nothing happens.  If I try to connect to a meeting (PMI or Scheduled), it acts like it's going to do something, says I'm in a meeting, but nothing happens.  If I keep trying eventually it will kick out an error of:  ""Unable to launch video meeting.  When possible, please restart your computer and try again.""

Suffice it to say I've restarted, a lot.  I also uninstalled Zoom Meetings, restarted, and re-installed.  Same behavior.  I used IOBit Uninstaller to nuke Zoom Meetings, restart, and reinstall, same thing.  I signed out and signed in with my work account, same thing.

However, I'm still able to use Zoom Meetings on my work computer, my laptop, as well as my wife's laptop.  I can also connect and initiat a meeting (PMI or Scheduled) on my IOS app.  I can even connect to a meeting using the web client on the desktop computer in question.

I just can't use the Zoom Meetings desktop client.

2020-05-19 00:15:57,Question about participants renaming themselves,"I had an issue last week where someone impersonated a student by using their name. Video was off but it was 100% someone else, they shouted and I removed them. However, I allowed this person in the meeting because they had the first and last name of my student. 

I want to avoid this again, and am thinking of all the ways I can. Something I came across is not allowing my students to rename themselves. Does this mean students can still change their name in the waiting room? 

We instructed them to log in to Zoom using Clever (a website hub that signs them into all their accounts) so that it automatically puts their first and last name as their username. But I still have some students trying to sign in on cell phones so their username is a series of random numbers. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Host online events with up to 100 interactive video participants. Plans range from 100 to 10,000 view-only attendees.

The [webinar FAQ sheet](https://zoom.us/docs/doc/Zoom-Video-Webinars-FAQ.pdf) says in different places:

&gt;  up to 100 video participants and 10,000 viewers
for a better, more interactive experience and 50,000 viewers upon request.

&gt; deliver online events with up to 100 video panelists
(49 per screen). Present to up to 10,000 attendees, and use Facebook, YouTube, or custom live streaming to broadcast to an unlimited audience. 

&gt; you can have up to 100 interactive video participants and unlimited viewers

&gt; Up to 100 interactive HD video participants (49 per screen) • Choose packages with 100, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 5,000, or 10,000 view-only attendees

2020-05-20 02:11:01,Change in Unmute Behavior,"In the 5.0.3 client, Zoom removed the unmute all function and now requires a participate to acknowledge being unmuted. This is majorly screwing up how I run meetings.

I often run meetings with about 150 people and a dozen speakers. Currently, as host, I have everyone set to mute when they join. I then unmute each speaker in turn and mute them at end of their time. This works great since I tell people they can start talking when they see a notice that the host has unmuted them. 

With the 5.0.3 update, Zoom has removed the ability to unmute a participant without them okaying it. This causes problems with meetings like mine, since I now have to train everyone to respond to the request for unmuting. This will slow down the flow of the meeting.

If Zoom is concerned that people don't want to be unmuted by the host, I suggest they add an option like ""Let Host Unmute Me Automatically"" rather than remove a critical feature.",1.0,1.0,1.0,26.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gmtvwu/change_in_unmute_behavior/,dem107

2020-05-21 13:28:06,Alt-tab update delays when sharing a monitor (not an application),"Yesterday I did some screen sharing (sharing my main monitor so I can switch applications on the fly). I switch often between Chrome and OneNote on a Surface Pro using alt-tab. OneNote is a great black board, pinch zooming, panning, flipping over the pen to erase, etc. So easy to annotate naturally. 

I have two zoom sessions open, so I can see what the participants see. I realized that although my alt-tab is merely a fraction of a second, the participants' share of my screen would show the overview of all the screens (when the alt key is still depressed), and then finally show the new application. With the transfer of all those screens, it seems like a delay of 2-3 seconds to update to the new application! It takes a lot of getting used to, because you have to wait to start talking about what's on the screen. 

Is there an option to get Zoom to reduce the delay between application swaps? Ignore that silly alt-tab screen? I couldn't find anything like shared screen refresh. Maybe I can turn it off in Windows.

Or does zoom allow hot-key changing of the share of different applications? I looked at prefs and couldn't find anything obvious.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gnqyf7/alttab_update_delays_when_sharing_a_monitor_not/,fuhrmanator

2020-05-21 22:22:27,Bad Zoom Experience: Will it Recur? How to Avoid?,"Hi,

Recently we had a Zoom meeting with 9 people where everything went bad.  From the start almost all participants were displayed in smaller boxes with notes that their connection speed was slow.  Sometimes an image would freeze, disappear, or update irregularly.  The sound was terrible: sometimes no sound for several seconds, sometimes noise like everyone was speaking at once (maybe they were), the box identifying who is speaking not working, and it seemed like at its worst no one could hear anything being said.  It was completely useless.  We terminated the meeting and restarted a new meeting, and all was well for about an hour and a half until it happened again.  By then we were mostly finished so we gave up for the night.  

Our concern is that we use Zoom for meetings of our photography group with typically 50 members viewing a presentation.  We've done this 4 times so far with no problems and in fact it's gone really well.  We've also done these smaller meetings maybe 8 or 10 times with no problem.  However we're concerned that if this recurs in one of these large meetings that's not acceptable and we need to find an alternative platform.    

The meeting was Tuesday 5/19 at 7:00 in a Boston suburb with generally good web connections.  When the problem occurred we tried shutting off our cameras but that had no apparent effect.  We didn't see anything on the news about internet outages or problems in the area or Zoom server problems.  We've had occasional problems before with low resolution or jumpy video or audio with individual participants in the past but they've been very rare and we've generally attributed them to wobbly WiFi.   

Is this a known problem with Zoom?  Any ideas what the cause might have been?  How likely is it to recur?  Is there anything we can do to avoid it?  Any help would be appreciated.

The format the host set up was one guest speaker (Panelist) after another, with them sometimes overlapping for a few minutes.

In 2 instances, the Panelist could not see the Host, but all of the attendees could. Everyone could also see the Panelist.

Instance #1 - The very first guest (Panelist) was a last minute addition to the meeting. We were originally supposed to start at 5pm according to the initial invitation, and at 2 or 3pm the meeting was altered to start at 4:30pm to include this new, and first in line, panelist. He was never able to see the host, but the host and all attendees could see him. He was annoyed because this was not normal.

Instance #2 - There was a bit of rearranging of the schedule during the meeting to whereas one guests logged in, got bumped to the end of the meeting because we were running behind schedule, and when he logged in for the second time a few hours later, he could not see the host. The first time he logged in went smoothly and he could see the host, but the second time he could not.

Is this a problem in the host's settings? Something to do with the invitations, or logging out and then back in? Maybe just a glitch?",1.0,1.0,0.67,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/goklg0/webinar_question_what_has_gone_wrong_if_a/,DentFeldman

2020-05-24 19:45:28,How is Zoom for streaming video games through screen share?,"Hi Reddit!

My friends and I love playing jackbox and jackbox-like games but due to COVID, we would need to play via a video conferencing/sharing app due to the quarantine. 

I’ve heard that Skype has issues playing the game audio in addition to the other audio (people talking) so while it offers screen share, Zoom might be a better fit.

We initially used Zoom in the past but it had a horrible echo (that MIGHT have been due to two attendees of the Zoom meeting being in the same room/household as we were using the one to stream the screen of the TV and the other to see the couple but we don’t remember).... but I don’t know if that issue would be resolved now that we are using Steam vs Nintendo Switch and a TV.

2020-05-26 02:16:13,"Multiple Zoom Calls, Audio Quality, Noise Suppression and Shared Screen Audio","I'm trying to coordinate a live concert of opera singers with a pianist over Zoom.  All performers are at home, by themselves.  I've already created support tickets with Zoom about the problems I'm encountering.  I was going to call Zoom up (they do have a telephone support number), but the recording says they're so slammed because of COVID-19 that they're only giving phone support to owners and businesses at the moment.

Which probably means they'll get to my problems eventually, if ever, and it could be weeks.

I don't want to wait weeks.  This opera group is very skeptical that this can be done, and are barely paying attention to my efforts, since they're drowning in unwarranted skepticism, partially due to ignorance about Zoom's many, many capabilities.

Since the group is not pushing to make this happen yesterday, and Zoom sure isn't pushing to make this happen, considering that they may not even get to me until July or something awful like that, it looks like I'm on my own.

Which is, hopefully, where you come in.

The following is largely a quote from the description of my problems that I've sent to Zoom.  I'm hoping one or more of you will be able to connect with what I'm talking about and maybe give me some guidance.  Meaning that, perhaps, we're not dealing with Zoom bugs but operator error on my part.  Here goes. 

I work with a group of operatic singers and pianists who want to do a live performance during a Zoom call. They all have pretty good mikes, as do I.

We were planning to use a live pianist to play at one home. That pianist would function as host for Zoom call [\#1](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/1). The singer would join that call from her home and would listen to the audio from that call on headset.

That singer would then join Zoom call [\#2](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/2) as well; the participants in Zoom call [\#2](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/2) would be audience members, all of whom would be muted, plus the singers, each of whom would be muted and unmuted one at a time for each item (the pianists would not have to be on Zoom Call #2 but, if they choose to join, they would be muted). The singer would then put onto her Share Screen the audio/video of Zoom Call [\#1](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/1) , so that the audience could see both the pianist and the singer performing. She would then sing in sync with the live piano from Zoom Call [\#1](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/1) to the audience in Zoom Call [\#2](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/2). Her own mike would be set to Original Sound with Noise Suppression off and Automatic Adjust Volume unchecked, as would the pianist's.

The first problem I bumped into was the multiple Zoom Calls participation.  The Join multiple meetings function is not showing up in the Meeting (Basic) parameters where Zoom claims it should be. So that's the first problem.  In some ways, this is the most important problem because, without that, I can't even get to first base.

The other problems have to do with audio quality and audio sync problems.

1) Even though the singer's Share Screen audio and live mike are leaving in perfect sync, as proven by a recording the singer makes of Zoom Call [\#2](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/2), by the time it reaches the users in Zoom Call [\#2](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/2) the Share Screen audio has been delayed in reference to the singer's live mike by about a third of a second. Why is this happening? Is there a way to fix this? Alternatively, is there a way to delay the singer's live mike in the upload transmission by one third of a second so that it arrives at Zoom Call [\#2](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/2)'s other users in sync with the Share Screen audio?

2) Even though the singer's mike is set to Original Sound, has turned off Automatically Adjust Volume, and has Noise Suppression disabled, nevertheless when she sings while the Share Screen audio is activated, the sound of her voice is being interrupted from time to time in a manner consistent with Noise Suppression, or is it, perhaps Echo Cancellation, that should also have been turned off when the mike was switched to Original Sound?  It seems that, for some reason, when Share Screen audio is activated, the Noise Suppression or Echo Cancellation or both is being turned on again. How can we correct for this?

3) There is also a noticeable quality issue with the pickup of the singer's mike. As I mentioned previously, the mike is high-quality, and when recorded directly, it is clean. But when the output of the mike is recorded off the Zoom call, even when Share Screen is off, Noise Suppression is successfully disabled and Automatically adjust volume is unchecked, there is a problem. While there is no longer any apparent spurious Noise Suppression or Echo Cancellation or any other such phenomena, there is noticeable underlying noise, sort of a rough gargly staticky sound accompanying the sounds of the singer. When the singer is not singing, it's fine. When the singer is singing softly, the problem is there slightly; when the singer is singing loudly, the problem is significantly more apparent. And no, the level is not too loud; the peaks are only reaching up to around 50% of the meter.

4) There are noticeable audible digital artifacts in the audio coming out of the singer's Zoom call-in to Zoom Call [\#2](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/2). When I look at Zoom mp4's that I'm making in MediaInfo, I see that the audio is 53K AAC mono audio. Obviously that won't do for stuff like this. However I've looked high and low for the audio adjustment and I can't find it. Ideally, I would like to change it to run the bit rate up to at least 96K or 128k. Where is that adjustment, please??? Thanks!!! I also note that everything's in mono at the moment. How do I switch to stereo? Just to clarify, the stereo is my very lowest priority. I'd rather have excellent-sounding mono than poor-sounding stereo.

Accompanying this report I furnished Zoom some files. The five files satisfactorily demonstrate the four audio problems we're having.  If someone here would like to take a look at those files, I'll happily upload them here

First file: This file is a recording from a user on Zoom Call [\#2](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/2). This demonstrates the audio sync problem involving the singer's Shared Screen audio and live mike, where the Shared Screen audio is approximately one third of a second behind the singer. In addition, you can hear the singer's live sound cutting in and out during the singing in what appears to be a spurious Noise Suppression that, supposedly, should have been defeated by turning on Original Sound.

Second file: This file is a recording from the singer's own Zoom app. In this recording is demonstrated two things. First, before the mix leaves the singer's Zoom app, the Share Screen audio and her live mike are in perfect sync; the sync problem appears to be getting introduced by something Zoom is doing when it sends the audio from the singer to the rest of the users in Zoom Call [\#2](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/2). Because in this recording, everything is in perfect sync. In addition, this file demonstrates once again the spurious Noise Suppression problem; once again, you can hear the singer's voice cutting in and out of the mix, even though Original Sound is on, Automatically Adjust Volume is unchecked and both Noise Suppression parameters are disabled. So this latter problem does not appear to be a transmission problem; it appears to be getting introduced by Zoom at the source. 

Third file: This file is a recording from the singer's own Zoom App. This time Shared Screen audio is not turned on. The mike is live, using Original Sound, Automatically Adjust Volume is unchecked and Noise Suppressions are disabled. Note that now, there is no audible noise suppression or echo cancellation or any audible volume changes or any of that crap. This would tend to confirm that, for some reason, some of that stuff is erroneously getting re-enabled when Shared Screen audio is turned on. We need to know how to get that stuff re-disabled when in Shared Screen mode, I'm guessing. So you need to tell us that. In addition, this file demonstrates the gravelly staticky sound that is being introduced into the mike's audio by Zoom, with none when the singer is not singing, slightly when the singer is singing softly, and noticeably when the singer is singing loudly.

Fourth file: This is a recording by the singer on the singer’s own computer of a mix from the audio that was used in the Shared Screen of the previous files plus the live mike that was used in the previous file. Please note this recording was NOT made with Zoom; it was made with a third-party application (Total Recorder, if you're curious). Please note that there is no problem with the singer's voice cutting out or with any audible noise suppression. This proves that that problem is being introduced, for some reason, by Zoom, and is not some inherent problem with the workstation.

Fifth file: This is a recording of the same mix as file Four, but with the background music turned off. Again, this was not recorded from a Zoom call; this was recorded with a third-party application (again, Total Recorder). The purpose of this file is to demonstrate that that staticky gravelly noise underneath the sound of the singer is being introduced by Zoom and is not an inherent problem with the mike. In this file, the singer's voice is clean, and there is no audible underlying gravel or static during moments when the singer is singing loudly.

Sixth file: This file is a recording from a user on Zoom Call [\#2](https://support.zoom.us/hc/requests/2). In this recording, all mikes are muted, and the only thing heard is the Share Screen audio from the singer. In this recording, you will hear some of the digital artifacts that are affecting the sound, particularly in the horns. Those artifacts are not in the original source.

Seventh file: This is an apples-to-apples comparison. This is a third-party application making a recording from the source music that was heard in the sixth file (again, the application is Total Recorder). In other words, it is taken down the same number of generations from the original as is the sixth file. But, as you can hear, there are almost no digital artifacts, and it gives a noticeably more faithful rendition of the original, even though the hiss noise level is actually slightly higher than in the Zoom recording. Neither is ideal, of course, but I infinitely prefer the sound on this file to the sound on the sixth file from Zoom. Hopefully this is a quick solution. If you can point me in the direction of the menu where I can change the audio codec and bit rate, I'll be a happy camper!

So there it is. We're bumping into these problems, we'd very much like to make this work, and we would enthusiastically welcome any help you can give us regarding the above operation.

Just to dot my i's and cross my t's, these three problems are occurring in every one of our meetings, on every date, and at every time.

So, to summarize, five questions:

1)  Why are we not seeing the Join Multiple Meeting option in our In-Meeting (Basic) settings?  
2)  Why is the Shared Audio from the singer reaching Zoom Call #2 with the Shared Audio being delayed about a third of a second, and how can we correct that, or, alternately, how can we delay the sound of the singer's mike a third of a second so that it once again lines up with the Shared Screen audio?  
3)  Why are we hearing the singer's mike cutting in and out when the Shared Screen function is enabled, even though we have Original Sound turned on?  
4)  How do we fix that underlying gravelly staticky sound underneath the sound from the singer's mike, that rises and falls in sync with the volume of the singer's voice?  
5)  How do I adjust the codec and bit rate of the audio for all users in both Zoom calls?

Thank you very much, in advance, for any guidance you can give me.  I really want to make this work, and if I can just get these pesky little glitches corrected, I think we can have a very good experience.  You folks are in a position to help me make that happen!

2020-05-26 06:05:29,Looking for a Production App Solution for iPad,"Hi everyone, I'm using Zoom for conducting online piano lessons.  Currently I'm using it on a PC (using OBS) and two cameras to produce a side view main shot with an overhead keyboard shot from above the piano simultaneously.  I have an OBS Plugin that creates a virtual cam feed, which I use for the main video feed in Zoom.


Is there any app for iPad like OBS that can duplicate this setup for Zoom?  I need to create more setups similar to my original but don't want to invest in multiple PC's as iPads are more versatile for my purposes.


I hope I got my question across correctly.  Please let me know if you need more details.  Thanks in advance!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gqkdp2/looking_for_a_production_app_solution_for_ipad/,rbwrath

I live in Aus, and just got the NBN installed. Before this I didn't have any problems with zoom, I was using it for both uni and work and it ran smoothly on my old internet with virtually no problems. But now that I am on the new network, I have been having problems with low bandwidth. My send bandwidth is averaging around 44 kb/s send, and I have high packet loss (&gt;60%) in my video send. People that I am in meetings with report that my video is very laggy and clunky. Whenever I try to screen share, they also report that it freezes and does not show what is on my screen. 

Here is the weird thing. Nobody else on my home network has this problem. Everyone in my household (who use zoom for uni and work also) have no problems with any of this. I am using a 2019 MacBook Pro, so it shouldn't have anything to do with it being outdated. I also found that when I change to my mobile hotspot, there is also no problems.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Why has Unmute All been removed, and are there plans to bring it back?**  
&gt;  
&gt;We removed the Unmute All feature from the user interface because hosts could unmute participants without their consent. We will reinstate this feature in the future. However, hosts will need a participant’s consent to unmute them during a meeting. 

&amp;#x200B;

You do realize you have elementary schools around the world using your product. I have 3 kids in school with 20+ classmates. This new feature rollout with no ability for the client to decide to permanently consent has caused total chaos.  Their classes now spend half of the time trying to have the kids unmute themselves though-out the class.  Just so you are aware this change is likely a product killer and I know at least our school district immediately started looking at alternatives. 

How and why did you roll this out without a setting for the client?",1.0,1.0,1.0,26.0,/r/Zoom/comments/grnl0f/consent_to_unmute_a_dealbreaker_for_kids_in_school/,spaznadz888

However, sometimes when I speak, I'll hear an echo which is really distracting. I assume the echo comes from the H4n microphone picking up the audio output from her computer speakers. The echo goes away when she mutes or uses headphones, but since she needs to be able to move around during the call (she plays violin), that's not a very good solution. There's also no echo when she uses her built-in computer microphone, but the sound quality is not good enough to teach violin with.

Is there some way for Zoom to understand that it needs to subtract the audio output from the computer speakers from the input of the H4n microphone? Thanks for your help!",1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,/r/Zoom/comments/grsx0f/external_microphone_causing_echo_for_other/,rising-dawn

In some cases they disappear altogether from the breakout room list.

However, they can't get back into the rooms after they are closed and reopened, they have to leave the meeting and rejoin again.

2020-06-01 17:50:59,Most basic of questions regarding Zoom,"My apologies but the sidebar here doesn't load for me if this info is already in there. I couldn't figure out what I needed from Zoom's website. 

Never used or downloaded Zoom and know absolutely nothing about it. I really don't want anything to do with it if possible, but my company sent me an email saying we have a critical meeting coming up and the invitation is a link with Zoom in it which instructs me to download the app, but the person inviting me also gave a phone number to call as well saying ""join by phone"". The number is answered by Zoom. 

I work on the road and we only have meetings maybe once every 3 months. For 10 years they've used a different platform where you could log into a website for the meeting or just call in and listen, which is all I ever did, and blocked my number as well. Basically I don't want them knowing if I attended or not and I've always rejected the tracking apps they've tried to get me to put on my phone. I just tell them my phone is old and the apps won't work. They are too cheap to buy me a new one so that has always shut them up. 

Sounds silly but in 10 years I've never seen anyone at the company and I'm not interested in seeing them now or explaining my current appearance--it's none of their business. I'm trying find out if it's possible Zoom works the same way were you can just call in while others are attending online. So my question is if it's a video-only meeting does Zoom requires a phone number to be given to participants like that?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/guhqkv/most_basic_of_questions_regarding_zoom/,Youarethebigbang

The parents now have to be involved and continually click the ""Yes to unmute"" button each time.

I've seen the ""it was a privacy issue"" and ""never bringing it back"", but here's my suggested solution.

When scheduling the session, the organiser selects options for the meeting: meeting will be recorded Y/N, the host can unmute participants Y/N etc. Some of these can be mandatory, so if the participant doesn't consent, they can't join the meeting. I believe this is the current approach with recording (if you don't want to be recorded you don't join). 

Then when joining the meeting the participants see these, and can chose whether to allow/deny these options before joining the meeting.

So a participant can join, know up front what the host can/can't do, and make a decision. Sort of like the ""This app wants these permissions"" prompts in Android or iOS. 

For those with special needs meetings, this allows the parents to consent once per meeting, and the host can then continue as normal.",1.0,0.0,0.5,6.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gvgulb/unmute_participant_suggested_implementation/,BeakerAU

""There appears to be an issue with your microphone, please select a different device and try again.""

Zoom's audio output to the UM-2 is consistently good; the problem is always the audio input. I do home studio audio recording so I know the mic and interface are working fine.

I'm frustrated because I can prep Zoom to work with the UM-2 prior to a meeting, but as soon as the meeting starts Zoom drops the input. I'm also frustrated because I filled out a lengthy help request with Zoom, only for Zoom to immediately mark the issue as ""Solved"" with a follow up saying they are no longer accepting help requests at this time.

Is there any way to pipe the audio from the main meeting room into the breakout rooms or into waiting rooms so that those waiting to be brought in can still hear the discussion?

Spun up a VM with QEMU/KVM (Virtualbox doesn't work on my laptop for some reason; I usually run VMs on the desktop but no webcam there). Microphone passthrough via HDA (ICH6) is choppy in testing, with quite a bit of noise added to the signal. And there seems to be input lag in both microphone and video.

I am putting together a virtual charity happy hour for my work this month. It's a long story but essentially one of our executives challenged an employee to a game on PS4 with the expectation that employees donate to the charity during the event. I am trying to figure out what the best way to do this is. 

Initially, I just thought we could have someone share a screen during a Zoom meeting, however, based on initial interest, I think there are a ton of people that want to attend this event (30+). Thus, I was thinking I should put people in breakout rooms and stream the video game from an alternate source (e.g. Twitch). Does this seem feasible? My thought is you would do the following:

\-  Assign 10 or so people to a Zoom breakout room to socialize/drink/etc

\-  Have the game streamed through Twitch and send to a link to all participants

\- Thus people can socialize and watch the game while interacting with others

Are there better ways to do this? The core issue is figuring out how to stream a single screen into multiple breakout rooms. Thanks for the help!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/gzev4e/streaming_video_game_into_breakout_rooms_virtual/,thelaminater

2020-06-09 21:38:36,Setting up a reserved Zoom meeting with a public link on a public website,"Hello everybody, 

I'm trying to sort out the best ""setup"" for a series of Zoom meetings considering I'm a newbie. 

I have a programme of mixed public and closed (I have a list of names+emails of admittable people) meetings that will be presented on a public website.

On this website I'd like every one of these events to come with a button linking directly to the relative Zoom meeting (for ease of use), here we have two use cases:

* the meeting is PUBLIC: everybody can get in up until full capacity (300 participants, I'm with Zoom Business); 
* the meeting is NOT PUBLIC: you get in and enter the waiting room, if your name is ""on the list"" I let you in, otherwise you're out.

What I'm focusing on here is trying to create the most ""seamless"" experience for the users by using the public website (it's a basic landing page with a programme) as the main platform to redirect users inside the Zoom meetings. 

What I'm worried about is usability: I have a total of 300 slots for direct participants to the Zoom meeting and 150 ""premium"" attendees, people that are admitted to the NOT PUBLIC meetings and that must have a ""place"" reserved during PUBLIC meetings. Therefore I have 2 questions:

* is there an easy way to reserve those 150 places for the PUBLIC meetings whilst leaving open entrance for the other 150 free slots? 
* is there a way to make NOT PUBLIC private but also reachable through the ""landing page""? Is there a way to AUTOMATICALLY let in a Zoom meeting people with a certain email (I have a list) and keep the rest AUTOMATICALLY out? 

Considering this setting, would be using Eventbrite useful?

Not sure if anyone has come across this yet, but I have two users that are saying they are unable to log in to Zoom (client, site, or via Okta after logging in and selecting the Zoom tile).

If I were a betting man, this seems to obvious that the causal link for the users are that they have all recently updated their AD account passwords. Is there something I am missing here? I've had them log out of VPN, not that they need to be on VPN anyway, since it auths through Okta.

I've had them try two different browsers. **Chrome throws a ""ERR\_CONNECTION\_RESET"" generic error** and IE does load our company specific zoom link, but when the user selected the **Sign In** option, they got a generic **""It looks like we are unable to connect. Please check your network connection...""**.

I'm now wondering if there are some extra steps that need to be taken when a domain user updates their domain password? I would think this would just replicate with Okta and then work just fine?

2020-06-12 06:07:51,Enable SSO with Existing Users,"Hey Yall -

I'm an Admin for a Zoom business account. I would like to enable SSO on our account (with G-Suite) but have a few questions and zoom support is backed up (I submitted a support request asking some of these questions a few months ago and still haven't heard back).

\#1) The majority of our users sign in with their domain e-maill address (more on that in the next question). I assume that once I enable SSO, it will handle linking their account in zoom with their domain account (when they use their domain e-mail address) and it will seemlessly start to have them log in with the google portal? Or will there be any hoops that I / the users have to jump through to get it all setup and going.

\#2) We have a few users in zoom that aren't in our Google Domain (for all intents and purposes, they are contract workers who need a licensed zoom account for their work with us). These users log in with their own, non-domain e-mail address. Will enabling SSO effect these users at all? I assume that we can continue to manually add users in the Zoom Admin interface, and that these users can continue to login with a User/Password like they have been.

I would be surprised if there were any major changes / impacts of switching to SSO (besides the easier login for Domain users) but I would like to make sure before I enable SSO on our account.

2020-06-15 12:17:37,Zoom Consent to Unmute,"This is the most frustrating change they have made in their recent updates.
For meetings that rely a lot on discussion and having multiple participants, this significantly increases the time the meeting will take (we unmute them, half the time they start talking right away and then the host will tell them they need to accept the request to unmute, they accept and then start their comment from the beginning)
I don't really understand what ""security"" this provides but can't zoom put a box on the client's end where they can just intentionally auto-consent these unmute requests? That way the users that want to 
be prompted every time (I've never known anyone who wanted this, and we've been doing zoom meetings since February) can stay that way, and the ones that don't (aka everyone) can just check the box. This will make the meetings flow better like before and since checking the box is intentional for each participant, zoom wont be liable.",1.0,1.0,0.67,6.0,/r/Zoom/comments/h98rw4/zoom_consent_to_unmute/,Lakititi

Enter Zoom.

I noticed, just opening the program without participating in a video chat makes my laptop run hot. The fans start to spin, first slowly, but they ramp up to full speed over about 15 minutes.

Please see both of the following pictures:  [https://imgur.com/a/snVtXyR](https://imgur.com/a/snVtXyR) 

The first one is my laptop plugged into power, just idle. It's base clock is \~2.2 GHz.

The second picture is 5 minutes after opening Zoom. I took the screenshot when my fans started to spin. It's quite easy to see that just opening Zoom increased the CPU speed to \~3 GHz.

I want to note that it's **not** the CPU usage that increases. Zoom just makes my CPU think that it needs to constantly Turbo-Boost for some reason. This cannot be healthy and my solution for the time being is to quit Zoom as soon as I don't need it anymore. This reverses the effects described here, which makes me very confident that the issue is caused by Zoom itself.

Is it just me, because I couldn't find anything about this behavior online? I would appreciate if other people could have a look at this.

But zoom is not showing me that as an option to share. It's showing me a Whiteboard option, but it's not the instance I have open, it's some kind of internal-to-zoom Whiteboard. 

I'm also having trouble sharing a Firefox page. Again, I have Firefox open in the background but when I go to share zoom does not show it as an option to share. 

This does not happen on my Thinkpad. I'm not sure what the problem is, but whatever it is it's not in my zoom settings, since on my Thinkpad I can see all the options to share. Sadly the Thinkpad is not a touchscreen, so I really need to make the Surface work. 

Is there any way to make zoom re-scan for apps to share? Or something? This is driving me mad, it's making my zoom meetings much less useful to my students. 

My school bought a pro account and I posted a question to zoom from their support page, but it was marked immediately as closed and I got an email telling me non-pro accounts no longer get supported. I replied to it saying I have a pro account and got the same email.

I have never had any issues sharing my screen until today. Whenever I tried to show the PowerPoint slides to my students, my screen started flashing and I got a message that says ""please move this window away from the shared application"". I tried closing every other window except Zoom and the PowerPoint, but I would still get the message. Restarting the computer helped the first time, but at some point during the lecture, it crashed again and had to restart at least a couple more times.  
I did a quick Google search but the only solutions I could find were to update my graphics card drivers (and they are up to date) or set the slide show to be windowed instead of full screen. None of these solved my problem.

Something else that happened after one of the times my screen blacked out is that the resolution was much lower when it came back on. Zoom did not crash again after this... I really don't know what is going on. Please help!

2020-06-19 23:34:39,Webinar Invites - Not Going Out After Registration?,"I have been producing a series of webinars.  Registration directly through ZOOM, email confirmation set to go out at time of registration, and reminders both 24 hrs and 1hr before.  we typically have between 300 and 400 register, but generally only around 150 are in attendance.  Additionally, we've had multiple people after yesterday's webinar say that they were not able to get in or didn't get a link after registering.

One issue may have been that the host account was in another webinar (watching not participating), until a half hour before... so that delayed me being able to open the room.  BUT, that doesn't explain why people a half hour into the webinar couldn't get in (unless of course their internet was wonky and they just never refreshed)

Regarding the registration links, I am stumped on that.  I think it has to be user error, either the registration was filtered to spam or they missed it.  As a safety, I include my personal email for people to reach out to if they have any technical issues either registering or accessing the webinar... and very few reach out.

Does anyone have any advice on how to troubleshoot these issues?  The people I am working with are not the most technologically savvy, nor are the participants necessarily... which is fine, I don't mind handholding.  I am just trying to make it easiest for everyone.

However, it might require a zoom URL for the ""--url"" argument, so I wouldn't be able to download an embedded Zoom recording posted on Facebook, for example. In windows the tool looks to be strictly CLI so no GUI.

If anyone has gotten the tool working, would you mind posting an example command, starting with ""start zoomdl.exe?"" If I can get it working for Zoom videos on FB, all the better.

There is some documentation in this app's github wiki, but no example CLI commands, so I haven't gotten it going.

2) Do hosts need to install the application to host a video?

3) Are you able to schedule zoom meetings ahead of time? I know with google meet you can generate a link and use that for a future scheduled meeting, can the same be done with zoom?

4) Is there a way to screen capture the zoom meeting within the zoom application?

2020-06-24 05:44:38,"When sharing computer sound, unable to control loudness of speaker on my end","Hi everyone!

Mac user writing with a problem I haven't seen yet on here — the challenge that when I 'share computer sound' in a meeting, the sound from my computer immediately bumps *way up* and I'm no longer able to really lower the volume. To clarify, the volume on the end of the other meeting attendees is fine; I can raise and lower the volume from my audio source (music app, browser, etc.) but this is only within that particular app, and  increasing and lowering the computer volume doesn't seem to impact anything...the voice of the other meeting attendees, as well as whatever else is playing, is incredibly loud and I can't really seem to lower it.

I use Rogue Amoeba's [Sound Source](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) to manage audio inputs and outputs and notice that when I 'share computer sound' that the input automatically changes to 'Zoom Audio Device' (which I'm assuming is Zoom's aggregate device that captures the selected mic source and all computer sound *except* for the other speakers on the Zoom call), but that my selected output remains the same. I can raise/lower the volume and nothing seems to change, except for occasionally when I go to the very bottom, almost muted.

What could be happening here? Any ideas?

* Play music, sounds, etc. from my computer *without* capturing the audio of other meeting attendees' voices

Looking for help in live streaming a wedding ceremony where one important participant is remote.  What I would like is to have the primary picture be the couple, with the priest in a box in a corner, where he's visible and audio but the focus isn't on him.

I can get as far as figuring out that it's a 2 person zoom meeting streamed to youtube for the 50 or however many viewers there would be.  But I can't figure out how I would send the Picture in picture video of the stream out.  I don't really want to do something where it flips back and forth between him and the couple, nor do I want to solely highlight the couple so that the priest is never visible.  I thought it would be less jarring to just have him down in a corner.

2020-06-25 11:51:47,Zoom / OBS / Voicemeeter - Audio Sync,"Hello there Zoom aficionados,

I'm a dance instructor and I have moved from 100% in-person lessons to 100% virtual lessons over the past few months.  I have been gradually upgrading my setup: wireless XLR mic, audio interface, DSLR, video capture card, upgraded internet speed (400 MBPS down, 20MBPS up), direct ethernet cable connection.  Things are generally going pretty well, but I'm trying to fix an issue that I can't seem to find an answer on.

I'm looking to create a delay on all of my audio sources except for my mic that go to stream so that my voice is perfectly in sync with with them.  Right now there is a delay of maybe 50ms between my mic and my audio source (Music player: Foobar2000).  The reason for the delay is because I hear the music on my monitor speakers (played from my laptop) and then I will count or talk on top of the music and the time it takes for my receiver to get my vocal audio and then pass to USB audio interface to encode digitally and then pass to Voicemeeter takes a small amount of time.  It's OK that I hear my counting a little bit late on my monitor speakers (I monitor my own mic), but it's not OK that my students hear my counting 50ms out of time.

I have included a diagram of my audio and video routing for reference, and am glad to provide whatever info is helpful to better understand my situation, but I'm really looking for a delay option either within Voicemeeter or as a VST pluging add-on to Voicemeeter that can apply a delay to certain sources going to certain outputs.  I thought that the obviously labeled ""Delay"" FX effect would be a good option, but I learned that delay in live audio jargon actually means echo to me.  Hah!

Anyways, thanks for the read!

TLDR: I need to create a 50ms delay in Voicemeeter for certain inputs going to certain outputs.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/hffk3d/zoom_obs_voicemeeter_audio_sync/,ByronWillis

2020-06-25 14:07:51,Solution : If Zoom is not recognizing your local recording files double_click_to_convert_01.zoom try this solution. It worked for me.,"Try this when ‘double click to convert’ fails rare occasions, even double-clicking on the files won’t be enough to convert them, and to help you proceed with the conversion, we have prepared the following guide based on a suggestion inside Zoom’s developer forum.

**Step 1:** Open the Zoom app on your Mac and start a meeting with yourself by clicking on the New Meeting button on the home screen.

**Step 2:** Click on the Record button at the bottom to start recording a meeting with yourself and then select ‘Record on this computer’.This will create a new recording folder on your Mac with the current date, thus giving you a bridge to convert you previously-recorded files.

**Step 3:** After a few seconds, stop the recording (but NOT the meeting) by clicking on the Stop button at the bottom.Note: DO NOT end your current meeting session.

**Step 4:** Open Finder from your dock, and head over to Documents &gt; Zoom &gt; \[Zoom recording folder with today’s date\].

**Step 5:** Copy your older recording file named “double\_click\_convert file.zoom” and paste it to this folder. If there are multiple recording files, then rename them as “double\_click\_to\_convert\_01.zoom”, “double\_click\_to\_convert\_02.zoom”, and so on, copy them and paste them to the Zoom recording folder with today’s date.

**Step 6:** After you’ve copied all your older recording to the mentioned folder, click on the End Meeting button at the bottom right of your Zoom meeting window.Zoom will now start the conversion process for all of your previously recorded meetings and convert them to MP4 and M4A files.

You will be able to access the converted recording inside Documents &gt; Zoom &gt; \[Zoom recording folder with today’s date\].",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/hfgvni/solution_if_zoom_is_not_recognizing_your_local/,venmul7

My question is, what shooting mode should it be in? Manual? Auto, Shutter priority, Aperture priority...?

\-Cam: use iPhone 7Plus via EpocCam OR buy a good Logitech webcam

\-Light: Get a ring light with a tripod-style light stand (8"", 11"" and 14"" only) OR a 12W LED clamp light that also comes with a webcam holder (I've checked and both are the same price). Will either look too harsh? Both have adjustable color temperature. Existing light is white house light. 

Some things about my situation though:

\-Using a Mac for the meetings

                So I'm in a zoom meeting for online classes and there are students from different campuses in one session. Now I made friends with this guy and we shared a tip or two in chats and generally he was very helping and all and I was to send him some notes. That was about to happen but a few days later the hosts ( not the teachers) disabled chats screen share and everything else. Now we're stuck and can't communicate at all. And a day later i missed a solid 2 hours of my class( I wasn't sent the updated link :/ ) and now I have no one to take notes from except just read the book material. So im asking of anyone of you know how I can possibly add this guy in my contacts ? I can't see his participant id and we can't talk during the lectures at all bc the teachers only mute unmute when they want. I understand this is to prevent zoombombing  but some of us just want to share some notes. So is there any way I can add this guy in my zoom contacts ?

I don't know whether this is relevant to this forum but I will ask my query anyway.

I have a 4G router, it works well, getting speeds of up to 30mbps, it is great for streaming videos, messaging, gaming you name it.

Doing a regular face to face zoom chat is fine but once I screen share the speed decreases significantly. almost to 4mbps.  My picture starts to jitter massively, web browsing becomes slow, basically the bandwidth is screwed.

At Google search, the only fews mentions to this error code was about some Zoom SDK DLL registers, something that have nothing about with us, end users of Zoom Cloud Meeting client.

The solution I found is very simple: in Zoom Cloud Meetings main screen, click Settings, than Share Screen item and check the option ""Enable the remote controle of all aplications"". It will ask for administrator credentials to register the Zoom sharing service to the Windows system.

I don't know why this happens to some users in Windows 7 (I have none complaining from Windows 10 users by now).

However, we've been noticing that it's very difficult to actually hear each other over the sound of the video. The problems seems to be that whenever there is audio coming through the screen share it automatically covers up the input from participants' mics making it nearly impossible to hear each other and leading to us having to regularly pause just to hear each other, which is very annoying. I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to either balance participant/system audio or to otherwise cut down the input audio from the system sharing its audio. Thanks!

I oversee the recording of a podcast each week, which we now run over Zoom, and thought I was improving the show by changing settings in the Record window:

1. Record a separate audio file for each participant 
2. Optimize for 3rd party video editor

The video is fine but when the separate audio tracks are imported into Protools or another editing software they aren't synced up.   


Is there an easy way to change this? whether it's a setting in Zoom or a trick to use at the beginning of the editing process?

One kid using an ipad will be able to play a puzzle game on it with no issues once I give them remote control, but another person using the exact same device won't be able to play the same game. In this instance, I can see the mouse moving on my end but it's not allowing them to click or trace anything on the screen and effectively prevents them from engaging in the game in any way.

I am using Zoom to manage virtual events for my work. Most of the calls have 100+ attendees, and I need to share a screen, usually PPT. I found the best way for me to share the PPT is to have the PPT open on my second monitor, not on full screen, and then use the ""portion share"" and adjust it on the slide only. This way I am not occupying my second monitor with the PPT and can toggle between the slides as needed, and stop and re-share as needed.

2020-07-08 03:18:49,Why you should use Lifesize instead of Zoom for Video Conferencing," If you've used Zoom, you've probably had some issues getting it working.

If you haven't had issues with Zoom, you probably don't know that Zoom Video Communications disabled security and media encryption by default in order to improve quality.

That means if you choose Zoom, you get either security and privacy OR quality.  


""Zoom is a cloud-based video conferencing service built on a custom architecture with downloadable apps for personal devices like laptops and mobile phones. Unlike Lifesize, Zoom does not sell meeting room equipment, instead relying on third-parties that bundle audio and video kits to support their customers’ video conferencing needs in meeting spaces. The Zoom video conferencing app allows the largest number of users (1,000 participants) to meet and talk at the same time.""  


""Lifesize is a cloud-based video conferencing and collaboration platform combining a software solution for personal devices like laptops and mobile phones with a full line of 4K video conferencing systems and wireless sharing devices purpose-built for meeting rooms. The strength of the Lifesize solution lies in the robust global network reliability, security standards and the tightly integrated industry-leading meeting room equipment which is supported end to end by Lifesize.""

  


Be smart, use Lifesize, which uses point-to-point encryption by default, and is one of the most user-friendly platforms.

I'm having a weird problem where Powerpoint slides are advancing automatically (occasionally) and I can't stop it. It's super annoying.

The touch to click options are also all off  (all of the gestures are off) and it should basically only advance when I use the keyboard or click but sometimes just moving the mouse around in that window (i.e., using it as a pointer) causes it to advance.

I've asked the same question on the webex sub, but it's worth asking it here too since Zoom has been used a lot lately.

I'm a bit curious about why most software for videoconferencing don't use a volume gate on the microphone.

I regularly use Teamspeak3 for chatting with friends.

The way it works it that you set a volume level on your microphone on windows, then on the TS3 application there's a Volume Gate option that allows you to activate your microphone when the captured sound is louder than X db.

Has this question been asked before? Is there an official standing on why the software it's adjusting the microphone volume based on the input instead of using a volume gate?

For Screen Sharing, I can't find a way to stop a participant shared screen (like when a Host disallow recording), except banned it all for all participants and only host can do Screen Sharing.

For Joining meeting without signing, I found Host will lost the chat history with the non signing participant, also this meeting will not get registered as ""previous meeting"". It is confusing this non signing participant can transfer file in a chat to everyone, but Host can't see it (I read, zoom take back this feature because malicious use).

2020-07-11 06:06:57,Zoom meetings only drop when my child is using it!,"Hi Folks,

This is the weirdest problem I've ever faced (certainly as a computer scientist and former IT admin). My son is taking Spanish classes with one provider and tutoring online with another. They were working fine until a few weeks ago when I upgraded my TP-Link Deco P9 firmware to the latest. Then it started happening. My son would be in his lesson for a few minutes and it would say ""meeting was ended by host"" or sometimes nothing at all. Joining again and again would result in the same drops within varying timespans (I haven't been rigorous but usually less than 5 mins).

Facts:

* I have a corporate account and a free account. My wife has a corporate account.
* I have a Windows desktop and 3 Windows laptops, 1 android tablet, an iPhone and an Android phone.
* My wife and I both hold Zoom meetings for 1+ hours on different devices, but mostly the laptops and the iPhone, sometimes with two-way video... basically zero problems.
* We've used both types of account (signed out and signed in).
* Latest Zoom is installed on every device.

What I've tried for my son:

* All devices on wifi with one provider and two of the laptops with the other
* A wired laptop
* A laptop connecting to the Internet using my Android mobile hotspot (this one really surprises me)
* A laptop connecting to the Internet over a VPN (wifi)
* A tablet over wifi that stayed connected to one provider for more than 30m with two-way video (no motion, no real interaction, just testing)
* Google Meetings on a laptop
* Skype on a laptop
* Facetime on the iPhone

Again, this *exclusively* happens when my son is getting online. I want to say it's only these two providers but fantastically, we also had it happen a couple times when he was speaking in Spanish with my brother-in-law and niece on Zoom (laptop).

I haven't tried going somewhere else yet and I haven't tried connecting audio via phone only.

The **only** two *known* commonalities that I can think of across all tested scenarios are my son's face/voice and the fact that his interactions are in Spanish.

At this point I'm starting to get really worried for fall when he goes ""back"" to school (f'in COVID). I'm pretty desperate for other suggestions.  Thanks in advance for any advice!",1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,/r/Zoom/comments/hoya3m/zoom_meetings_only_drop_when_my_child_is_using_it/,hallmarc

I am trying to help a friend who has a weird problem with Zoom.  He connects to the meeting fine, his microphone works fine, but he cannot hear anyone else speaking. 

I checked his computer in person.  The volume is up, the built-in Dell laptop speakers are selected.  When I go to youtube or elsewhere, sound comes out of the speakers just fine.  But, in Zoom, there is an initial sound when someone starts talking, but it immediately kind of garbles and drops totally off to no sound at all. 

I tried restarting, still has the problem.  I didn't have other speakers to try, but it doesn't seem to be a hardware problem, since the speakers work on other websites.  

When I play the test sound, that is also not audible.

Has anyone else encountered this and/or think of a possible solution?

What it neglects to clarify relates to the following situation: you have a waiting room-enabled room, a meeting link with the passcode embedded, and start your meeting. Can you then disable your waiting room and let people join as they appear? Will those people need to enter a passcode since you have disabled your waiting room, even though the meeting was setup to initially include a waiting room?

LiveSensus is working on a project that measures a listener's tolerance to different audio issues that may come up during live streams, video conferencing call, and online lectures.

LiveSensus has created a machine learning program where users can rate audio clips based on their perception of the quality. At this point, the website is launched and we are seeking respondents interested in testing out our easy 5 minute demo. All data will remain confidential and anonymity will be ensured.

We've been really excited to get this project up and running in a Covid-19 world where many workers, students, etc., are transitioning to online alternatives. Please feel free to contact us with any questions and most of all any comments for improvement. Any insights would go a really long way!

You can access our website at: [livesensus.com/](https://livesensus.com/)

My goal is to provide live transcription to a hearing impaired customer of mine to save them having to have a live interpreter at every Zoom meeting. So far it is seeming that this customer would need to host every meeting she attends to guarantee she gets the transcription, and it isn’t realistic to provide my entire company’s staff with the software so that every host has the transcription software.

2020-07-16 23:23:47,Shared screen goes black after 15-30 minutes,"  

I have a ticket open with Zoom support for over a month now and can’t a resolution to a shared screen issue and I am hoping maybe someone else has seen this issue and knows of a solution.

For the past month a large portion of my users have been having issues sharing content with the desktop application. Somewhere between 15-30 minutes after initializing screen share the content turns to a black screen. The presenter can usually get it back by stopping / restarting the shared screen, but a lot of times they have to actually disconnect from the call and reconnect to get content showing again.

As a workaround, we have been having the presenter connect through the web app instead of the desktop application which seems to hold the content better, but I did get another report this morning that the issue happened while sharing through the web app. I am also getting complaints that bypassing the desktop application can be difficult depending on the browser.

This issue is present with Windows 10 and OSX and happens when using the Zoom application. We were first directed to this [support article](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/202082128-Black-Screen-During-Screen-Sharing), but we are seeing this issue with laptops that don’t have NVidia graphics.

We have updated all drivers, have continued to update the Zoom application with each patch release, turned off hardware acceleration, added exceptions for cphost.exe in the graphics control panel turning off anti-aliasing and 3D acceleration, and for the systems that do have NVidia cards, we set the Cpthost.exe to run on integrated graphics.

We also explored the possibility that the issue was caused by a poor home internet connection, but during sessions where we were able to replicate the issue bandwidth tests were showing 100Mbps down and 20 Mbps up. Also, given that the issue had been happening on the desktop application, I don’t think it was a bandwidth issue.

The network analytics from the dashboard for the presenters show no signs of issue. Straight lines with 0% loss almost no jitter/latency.

We have sent Zoom several dozen example meeting IDs with the timestamp of when the share issue started, sent recording of it happening, and replicated the issue with a Zoom engineer in the session.

 So far the response is that they are looking into it and to try using their logging version, but the link they sent us was for a web app, not the desktop app and we get an error when trying to force Zoom to use the logging web app saying that we need to use the desktop version.

Has anyone else seen this issue or know of any other avenues we can try?",1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,/r/Zoom/comments/hsbk0h/shared_screen_goes_black_after_1530_minutes/,unkinkedelf

I have had problems with choppy video while doing this.  My problem may have been my internet connection and I have taken care of that. Part of the problem might be my older computer. I have noticed that my CPU is maxed out for a moment when I start videos in Zoom. 
 My understanding is that highly compressed videos are more work for the computer, but are better for streaming because  they are smaller. So, if I were posting a video online I would want the file to be compressed. But Zoom isn't streaming my video from the file.  Zoom is watching VLC play my video and then compressing and sending what it sees.  
 Therefore, I think my best option is to screen share VLC playing a large uncompressed video.",1.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,/r/Zoom/comments/htk0kf/technical_video_question_which_video_format_is/,idiotater

2020-07-21 06:53:17,Cloud storage full. Is video recoverable?,"Hey.
This is a question from a friend who doesn't have Reddit.
They have premium Zoom and has it set to automatically record the meetings they host, and it goes to the cloud storage. I think they forgot or ignored the storage full email and did an important meeting today.
Their wondering is it possible to get that video? Or was it even recorded. I thought maybe it would set to locally save if cloud isn't available or maybe it will upload if they delete old videos on the cloud.

I said I'd ask here to see if anybody knows if there's anything to be done

When I downloaded the Zoom installer, another item apparently came along with it. It is identified as MacRetinaRes.zip, inside of which is something identified as zMacResRetina.bundle, 2.6 MB in size.  


This file did not accompany Zoom when I installed it on either of my computers, identified below in my sig.  


Searching for information on this file identifies it with a Japanese company called Rakuten, which is their version, I think, of eBay, which does not make a heck of a lot of sense.

2020-07-24 00:56:25,"URGENT"" Webinar Participant's video not showing or being allowed to even request turn on video. HELP ME","I have a few questions regarding webinar feature on Zoom that have been giving me trouble. I'm helping my boss who is trying to hold a very interactive talk using keynote, and he wants to make it so particpants can see him and he sees them, but have their audio muted and only allowed to be unmuted by HIM, and not them. See questions below.  Right now, in webinar, only participant's audio works if the host asked to unmute them. But in meeting, they can unmute themselves without permission. 

1 Can all attendees in webinars be seen at once?

2 If no, can we have someone who raises  their hand, upgrade to participant, so we can se their video and audio so they can ask a question?

3 Since I’m showing video and pictures in keynote as screenshare, is there a way to control the host’s video size to be bigger? It appears only attendees can change host’s video size from a very small thumbnail? He's talking a lot and wants to be seen larger. 

This is an interactive talk and my boss wants to make it so participants can be seen (if they agree), but in webinar videos can be seen of participants, and can host control his video size when sharing screen as it appears only attendees can change size and how to make it so audio CANNOT be unmuted by participants in a MEETING.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/hwja62/urgent_webinar_participants_video_not_showing_or/,LobsterMan101

For frame of reference I am looking to record all participants of a zoom call, gallery view obviously gives me that but if the overall video is 720p then each participants window is going to be at a low resolution. The recording would be done via server using OBS to scrape the window meaning bandwidth is not an issue. Ideally I was wondering if I could set my remote screen to 4k and this would bump up the resolution of the individual windows in gallery view. If anyone can give me any advice on this or suggest another way of doing it, the only other workaround I can think of is running multiple remote sessions each joining the zoom call and recording a singular participant.

 This occurs randomly and can't be predicted. Some time into the meeting on my phone, if I feel that I need to share a piece of code, I usually try to switch to my laptop. Here's the odd part. Sometimes, in this case, it grants access, while other times, it doesn't.

2020-07-25 06:52:13,Trying to record two screens side by side,"Got a very particular problem I'm trying to solve. I'm a filmmaker, and I'm about to shoot a short film consisting of a series of Zoom conversations between two people. I want to have the two screens side by side, and I'll record the scenes that way.

Thought this would be easy, but I can't figure out how to make it work.

If I host a conversation between three people and hide myself from view, then the two remaining screens are stacked vertically, not horizontally -- this won't work for me. 

When only two people are on Zoom, their screens are side by side. So I could have one of my actors host the call, and she could also record the call. But then for me to direct properly, I'd want to be able to see and hear the entire call as well. I could have the actor set up a tablet or smartphone off to the side and then FaceTime me on that device so I could see what's on her screen, but that would mean I'd be getting a poorly angled view of things with low-quality picture and sound.

An alternative would be to have one of my actors host and record the call, and then she and I will share our laptop screens (both Macs), so I could see and hear the call from my computer without actually being on the call. This is the best solution I've come up with so far, but I still don't love it, because I'm asking the actor to do extra technical stuff when I'd much rather have her just focus on her performance.

I know there are ways to have each actor record her own screen, or even pin and record the other screen, and then edit the two together, but this isn't what I want either -- I want both screens, next to each other, being recorded at once.

So the ideal situation would be to have me hosting and recording the call but absent from view, with the two actors' screens side by side... Any suggestions for how to make this happen?

2020-07-25 08:47:29,Is there a way to integrate donations during a Zoom meeting or webinar?,"I am a tour guide in Panama and have been conducting live virtual birdwatching tours in the rainforest via Zoom.  Using our cell phone cameras attached to high powered scopes, we have discovered that we can transmit high quality live videos of birds and animals in the rainforest. Originally our plan was to charge a fee  ($8.99) for the virtual tours but have had little success finding people willing to take the tour, probably from doubt about the quality of a birdwatching tour via Zoom. We have had amazing feedback from the few people who have taken the virtual tour, with all of them saying that they feel we should have charged more.  Many of them actually asked for a way to add to the amount they already payed. So now we have the idea of offering it for free and asking for donations during and after the tour.  Is there an efficient way of adding a donation link or to integrate it without sacrificing the quality or overwhelming the tour with begging? Stuff like Venmo aren't available in Panama and since we have to limit the size of the groups we can't afford to do something like Patreon.  Any info you have would be greatly appreciated.  In case you are wondering here is a description of the virtual experience:

This guided virtual tour will be broadcast live via Zoom with our expert tour guides who are both naturalists and historians who can answer any of your questions while they show you our beautiful country.

This virtual tour will begin when the birds are most active at 6am local time in Panama.  The tour will start at the Pipeline Road in Soberanía National Park.  One of the premier birding spots in the world, the Pipeline Road will give us an opportunity to watch birds in a mature rainforest that is full of an incredible mix of wildlife. A bird count here organized by the Audubon Society set a record when 385 species were observed in only 24 hours. We will walk along a series of trails that will take us to a panoramic view of Gatun Lake where we can see different species of waterfowl and aquatic animals.  We will spend around 2 hours birdwatching and looking for native wildlife that lives in the areas right next to the Panama Canal.  We will be stopping along the way as we discover sloths, toucans, monkeys, and the many other species that reside in one of the most biodiverse areas on the planet.

Once we finish with our birdwatching at the Pipeline Road,  we will continue with a driving tour of the Canal Zone town of Gamboa, where we will see a small remnant of Americana that remains nestled in the rainforest. While your guides tell you about the unique history of the Panama Canal Zone, we will drive by sites such as the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, the Panama Canal Dredging Division, and see the houses that were left by the Americans when they transferred the canal to Panama in 1999.  We will then spend a few minutes next to the Panama Canal where the Chagres River meets the Canal and  watch the transiting ships entering and exiting the famous Gaillard Cut.

A live, interactive virtual tour with at least two knowledgeable tour guides. You can ask as many questions as you like and participate as much or as little as you want

The tour will be conducted with the Zoom app, which is free to download and use
This is a shared online experience that you will enjoy with other guests from around the world.

This tour is in English

This is a nature tour, and your tour guides will be equipped with powerful spotting scopes attached to the cameras

During the driving portions of the tour the tour guides will stop to appreciate as many points of interest as possible. However due to restrictions in place by the Panamanian government due to Covid-19, we cannot enter any buildings or attractions.

This is a great way for you to support local tour guides during this crisis, as the tourism industry will be hit hardest during these trying times",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/hxdlu5/is_there_a_way_to_integrate_donations_during_a/,panagringo

The show involves a casting director and his/her assistant auditioning a bunch of crazy characters for a part on a TV show. Each scene starts with the casting director and the assistant and then gets into the next actor. We’re trying to record it so that it’s in gallery view so we can see all 2-3 characters per scene at the same time. The other characters are n the waiting room and the casting director has been hosting the entire meeting and recording. Scene 1 recorded fine, but from scene 2 and onwards it was all of a sudden in active speaker mode so it kept jumping to whoever was speaking instead of remaining in gallery view. 

Does anyone know why this could’ve happened?  Does it have something to do with other characters being in the waiting room and coming in and out?  We don’t want everyone to be seen so we figured placing people in the waiting room was the right answer. 

Any suggestions?  There are 16 characters, but we only need 3 at a time on screen at most.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/hyhpx8/needing_help_with_recording_a_play_performance_on/,MusicEd921

2020-07-28 02:09:38,teaching a class &amp; have questions ...,"I hope this is the right sub-reddit. If there's a more appropriate sub, please let me know.

Before the pandemic, we taught computer usage in-person with a hands-on approach by using a projector for the class to follow.  With the pandemic, we're finalizing doing the same virtually. I'm subscribed to Zoom Pro and also have access to Hangouts Meet (from Google's G Suite product).

What I want to do is basically these steps:

1. At start of each class, show the students ( about 10 to 12) in a grid with myself at corner. Basically for welcome and Q&amp;A as each program is a series of classes.
2. Switch over to sharing my screen. It may also be running a mirroring program depending on the subject covered like smartphones or tablets. Again, this is consistent with the in-person program where I show my screen through a projector. At this point I would like the students to see only my screen but also in the corner - myself speaking. The best explanation is when many YouTubers show the screen, like them playing a video game, and have another video feed in the corner.
3. At end of each class, show the students in a grid again for Q&amp;A.

So the questions might be:

1. To attain the above flow with almost no switching by students (they are seniors), can it be done on Zoom Pro or Meet?
2. If so, does it need OBS or something similar to setup the screen to be shared?
3. If not what should I use instead of Zoom or Hangouts Meet? I did use Zoom Webinar once for one event but there is no budget to continue monthly.

2020-07-28 02:34:00,Audio from other apps silenced during meetings,"I don't know why, but when I'm on a Zoom call of any kind on my laptop,  all audio output from other applications that I have open at the time is totally silenced. The audio will jump right back as soon as I hang up the call, but while I'm on a call I can't hear anything else. The audio of the call is alright. My only complaint there is that changing the master volume of my computer does not affect the audio output from my call, and I have to manually adjust that via the in-app audio output slider in Settings which is a nuisance. It hasn't been a huge issue until this point; at most, it's been a significant  inconvenience. However, I'm running into more and more situations where I need to diagnose and address the issue. I didn't even realize at first that this was a problem at all because I assumed that this was the case for all users, but I have discovered over time that it seems to be unique to my computer. I can't find any official documentation nor online forums about this issue either which is why I was going to reach out to Zoom Support, but they're isn't taking new issues right now because of the upsurge in support tickets.

2020-07-28 10:02:08,Screen goes black on Zoom while screen sharing — other participants can still see/hear me,"Hi! I'm posting here to see if someone has had this issue before because it's breaking me and my tech's head! I did not find another thread with this exact issue, if I missed if please let me know.

I have an X553S Asus laptop, I've had it for around 4 years. I mainly use it for online classes, which include me streaming myself for 2-8 hours a day with 1-5 other people. Three weeks ago I sent my lap to the tech for an upgrade: went from 4 to 8G RAM (in one slot) + solid-state drive. Everything seemed wonderful, I could feel the difference. BUT I started having an issue with my monitor:

Whenever I'm giving class I share a presentation and have my video on, and I use annotate tools a lot. When I'm in class, my screen flickers for a bit and then goes black, but like they turned off the lights... the other participants can see + hear me, and I can write/click on stuff and even turn on/off mic and cam with commands. It does not always go completely black but when it does I can't recover my screen and have to force shut down.

My tech has been with me remotely through TeamView and he does not get the flickering nor the black screen. I have been connecting a monitor with HDMI to be able to teach and everything works fine —except for my screen.

I've sent my computer with the tech three times after the upgrade and they've told me everything inside is in place, it's not a missing cable or a false contact. The drivers were updated, we tried different versions of Windows, and right now, the last resource was to return the original 4G RAM and see if the cause was that the lap was not supporting the new RAM but it happened again!

Idk if it's a coincidence but ever since I started connecting the other monitor, it flickers but as soon as I plug in the HDMI cable, even if the monitor is off, it does not go to entirely black screen. But as I say Idk if I'm just looking for coincidences now.

It has only happened one other time when I'm not sharing screen on Zoom, but I was on full-screen mode, so I figured it might have to do with the app. It has been unistalled-installed in different versions a bunch of times.

I'm attaching some videos I've taken when this happens. Thanks a lot if you read all of this!

During a conference call our chromebit stopped video about every 5 minutes while on zoom.  


My first thought was the USB hub being used, but we never lost audio so it wasn't the physical connection.

Chromebit is at a current and stable version of Chrome OS. 

My next thought was connection to the AP. but no one else had an issue in the room, and my ubiquiti system showed zero issue with connection or interference.

Network speed was normal the entire time.  


  
My only other suspect is an issue with the Zoom itself on Chrome OS.

2020-08-01 23:57:56,Audio Mixer for Mac Book Pro,"Hey gang!  
Looking to improve the production quality of a live podcast / gameshow we've been producing on zoom while broadcasting on facebook live with a current mac book pro. 

Typically to get the audio for our intro and speed round music I need to share my screen and play the file but then it clearly stops when I finish sharing but I need our speed round music to continue.

2020-08-04 00:51:09,Which plan do I need? Feeling kind of overwhelmed,"Hi, I'd like some help to pick what plan and add-on's should I get form my event. 

Here are the details:

I'm planning to host a 3 day long event. We expect around 600 attendees. There will be these main type of sessions:

* Plenary Lectures: 1 speaker + 1 moderator on screen. Attendees should be able to ask questions via chat or a Q&amp;A system. We don't need attendees to share their webcam/audio. No sessions in parallel.
* Symposia: 3-4 speakers + 1-2 moderators on screen. We need to run at least 5 sessions in parallel (attendees should be able to join their desired parallel session without a host assigning them to it, i.e.: each 'room' or 'session' should have it's own link and be able to run simultaneously with the others). Same Q&amp;A needs. We don't need attendees to share their webcam/audio.
* Roundtables: This would be nice to be in a meeting format (everyone shares audio and video). We expect around 100 participants in these. We might need to run up to 2 or 3 sessions in parallel.

On top of that we would like to have multiple hosts or co-hosts to act as moderators. In each session we would want the moderator to be the main host and two co-hosts to provide technical assistance if needed. During the Q&amp;A it would be nice that instead of the moderator reading the question, the person who asked can jump in with cam and video if they want, but it's not necessary. Do we need 3 hosts or 3 hosts timed by the amount of parallel sessions (so, if we do 6 parallel sessions we would need 18 hosts)? Do I need Zoom Roms with n rooms (n = the amount of parallel sessions I want)?

The best-case-scenario she'll be in and out of a meeting for between two and three hours a day. Worst-case-scenario, she'll be in on for 5 hours.

Well, Disneyland is closed, and as someone who is high risk for COVID-19, I don’t feel comfortable going to a restaurant with a big group. So, I figured the best option this year was to have a get together on Zoom. Now here is the problem: I have no idea what we should do, and people I’ve invited have started asking. 

I thought about Cards Against Humanity, but the online version only allows for six players and I’ve invited more than six people. I’m also sure not everyone has an actual copy of the game, so we can’t play that way either.

Think of it as a combo of a receiving line and going from table to table at the reception to thank people for coming and connecting with guests since we won't be doing that directly with individuals during the ceremony.   I can't figure out if I should try Break Out Rooms or send separate reception invites for different times to groups of 10-12 guests.

2020-08-08 10:27:10,Help with featuring only a select few members of a class to give a group presentation.,"Hello everyone. I teach classes comprised of around 10 to 15 performing arts students who often work collaboratively in small groups outside of class to create work. Is there is a way in Zoom for me to do the equivalent of having a few students come to the front of the class to give a demonstration together? I'd like all the other participants in the class (zoom meeting) to only see and hear the video and audio of the group that is presenting at the moment. 

The closest thing I've been able to find is to have everyone to enable ""hide non-video participants"" in Zoom settings, and then have everyone not in the presenting group mute their audio and stop their video. I haven't been able to try this out with a group yet so I don't know if it works the way I imagine or hope that it would. 

Am I on the right track or are there any other suggestions of how to do this in Zoom?

2020-08-08 20:15:17,Looking to hire a professional streamer for an online web conference about mental health illness and awareness in the gaming industry.,"Hello all! (first post here, if I am breaking any rules, please let me know and I will change it asap)

I am most likely looking for a producer to help coordinate all of the below. 

You don't need to be a streamer with 100k subs, instead I am looking for someone who knows the nuts&amp;bolts about streaming inside and out and can be a live producer with Zoom. 

Here's what I need in a nutshell.
I founded a mental health summit for the video games industry about 4 years ago and after 2.5 years of planning we had our first event last year live here in Toronto during October (World Mental Health Day is October 10th).

I worked in the gaming industry for almost 21 years but had to stop 5 years ago because of my own illness.
But the success of our event proved that we had tapped into something that was crucially needed for our industry to mature and better take care of ourselves.

You can see some of the videos of the event from last year here.
https://tigs.ca/videos/

But obviously we can't do live this year but that actually opened up our reach of getting speakers from around the world to participate, so that's great actually.

But I know my own limitations regarding streaming and capping a live conference and knew that we would need to find someone to handle the production of the event, someone with experience in Zoom and foremost and also Twitch and YouTube and has the necessary bandwidth (I mean real physical internet bandwidth, at least 500Mbs up and down that's what I have at home) to be our online producer, preferably you are based in Toronto or the surrounding area. If you are US based, that's fine, but you will be paid in CAD dollars. 

The Summit is over two days, October 7th and 8th, and we have about 70 speakers from around the world (from EU/UK to North America West Coast) and are starting the event at 9am PST and going to 5-6pm PST.

Everyone from the UK and EU will be in the morning sessions and as we move across the time zones, people on the West Coast will be in the later sessions.

So ideally I need someone who knows Zoom (or Teams or Meet) inside and out. 
And knows how to live broadcast via Twitch/YouTube, and can make static slides for the next session for the mods and speakers, and that you can also save it all locally for archiving purposes on YouTube.

If this is of interest to you, please let me know and we can set up a time to chat further.
Here's a little primer on me and why I started this (I never should have left Epic Games in 2004, hah!).
https://safeinourworld.org/stories/my-bipolar-story-by-mark-chandler/

Pay will be daily and will be commensurate with your experience. The more experience you have, the more you will be paid in other words. 

If you are a person that has/had mental health lived experience, that's even better. 

And ideally someone who can act as a host and be able to fluff out a session for any sessions ending a minute or two early. 

Please DM me if this is something you are interested in and can do professionally based upon the above requirements, references are mandatory. 

Thanks kindly,

2020-08-09 23:57:00,Filter for participants tab,"   I had an idea today while in a zoom meeting with over 70 participants. The subject being discussed was in a Q&amp;A format, so I had the task (along with a few others) to make sure when people were done talking their hand was lowered, and they were muted. Anyone who's had a similar experience understands that this situation is quite literally a game of Whack-a-mole.

    I like how the participants tab is alphabetical.... for the most part. Things are alphabetical - until you get to the top. That area is constantly changing as hands are up, and down, people mute, people unmute, etc.... I've run into the issue several times of lowering the wrong hand, or unmuting/muting the wrong person because their name will go back to a lowered position and I'll click the wrong name. (Maybe I'm not going to enter a Whack-a-mole tournament anytime soon)

   So that's where I had the idea of a filter for the participants tab. You could toggle each of the status' for a device as you desire. I'd like to see only devices that have a hand up. Boom, done. Only those who are muted. Boom. Just those who have their camera on (in the participants tab, I know that's a thing in the camera tile portion of zoom) boom, done. And then disabling all the filters could revert to the way it is now, except the names STAY alphabetical, since there is a manual filter.

   Maybe I'm the only one who's encountered this problem. Maybe those who share my issue have found an easier way to manage it? I'd like to hear from the community.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/i6lnnv/filter_for_participants_tab/,ggriffith3

I need help ASAP on a frustrating Zoom issue...I feel like I'm constantly finding some kind of workaround in regards to breakout rooms...but this one has me stumped. I am hosting two large corporate meetings this Wednesday August 12 and need some guidance. Appreciate your help. Here's my (current) issue:

With waiting room enabled...the host can see participants as they arrive into the waiting room, and the host is then able to assign the participants to breakout rooms that they will use later on in the meeting. So, imagine 40 people in the waiting room and in the host's breakout window you have 10 breakout rooms all with 4 people assigned to them...PERFECT! But then - you admit all into the meeting and the breakout rooms all clear out competely and must be done again.

Am I missing something? How can keep the breakout room assignments entact when I bring them into the main room for the meeting setup? I'm about to pull my hair out..",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/i7jnya/zoom_waiting_room_and_breakout_assignments_help/,Spires_Oaks

2020-08-13 02:35:59,best recording quality settings?,"For background I manage Zoom webinars for work and I have a good handle on Zoom's features, settings and quirks. 

For work I record our events but only use the audio for them so I haven't paid a lot of attention to video quality. I've found that making multiple participants co-hosts and recording to Cloud to be the best/safest way to capture the event. In case there is lag, a blip, or internet outage on my side (which has happened!) having multiple hosts recording to the Cloud ensures the video does not show these blips or doesn't stop recording if my internet goes out. I assume if I wasn't recording to the Cloud and was instead recording locally, the video file would show exactly what my screen sees, meaning it would have those blips and of course the \~20 second outage, if those were to occur. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting married in a week and a half and we will be connecting with our officiant through a one on one Zoom call.

I'm trying to figure out the best settings to use to produce the highest quality video and audio recording of our \~30 minute ceremony. 

My goal is to capture **the best quality video and audio from the officiant.** I'll have some stationary cameras recording the ceremony on my end and afterwards I'll edit the files together into one wedding ceremony video. Having a great recording of my end with the officiant being laggy or of a lesser quality is not ideal.  


So my questions are:

\-Do I record my ceremony locally or do I record it to the Cloud? 

\-If I record to the Cloud, should I make the officiant also a co-host so their feed is directly recording to the cloud as well in case there are any internet blips on my end? 

\-If I record locally (which most online say does produce the best quality video) how do I ensure I get the best quality video from the officiant saved onto my computer?

\-Or should I maybe have the officiant themselves record locally as well to hopefully produce the best quality on their end?

\-What settings in Zoom (if any) can I change to ensure the highest quality of video from the officiant?

Self-funded and self-produced, Phase is a sci fi comedy filmed during lockdown, remotely, in isolation, entirely in Zoom about a day in the life of a performer as he hangs out on zoom chatting to family and friends waiting for his evening livestream gig - and maybe fighting off an invasion of pan-dimensional clones. It features a host of popular British comedic talent including Phill Jupitus, Stephen Frost, Janet Prince, Stu Goldsmith, Katie Pritchard, John Henry Falle, Alexis Dubus and more.

We've got some great perks available for donators and we are trying to do as much as we can digitally so that the money we do raise can all be spent on the film. 

I'm currently in Post Production and need assistance to pay everyone who has helped me out so far and to get soundtrack &amp; sound mixed and recorded, artwork commissioned and colour grading done. 

All the info, trailers and photos are here – https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/phase - and I'd love it if you could check out our project.

Thanks for reading,

Cheers!

2020-08-13 20:31:15,Need help on freezing/delay while on zoom meeting,"While on a zoom meeting it is always stuttering and freezing for only 2 seconds then will be back to normal. I’m on online classes, it gives me a difficult time on understanding the teacher. It’s not only on zoom also on Gmeet (the google video conference website) same problem. freezing and stuttering.

My internet is good running at 40mbps both download and upload speeds. I tried to run a speedtest while on zoom and it is still 40mbps. There are estimated 8-9 devices per day connected and two of those are also on zoom but they are not lagging. Our wifi is a Mesh Wifi system and my pc is connected on the 2nd node. 1 device on zoom is also connected on the 2nd node but it isn’t lagging. The other one is on the main node so there are no lags at all. My pc uses a wifi dongle because a wired connection is not possible due to the position of the node. 

Can anyone help me out? I badly need some solutions. Online classes are starting.

But the others, get to see and listen her ok.

For example, on this machine which is a i7-3840QM (quad core) with 16gb RAM, it still says the hardware is insufficient. Adobe creative cloud apps and Windows system properties etc. all recognize that there is an i7 quad just fine. Only Zoom does not.

Teams and Google Meet allow me to do custom backgrounds without a green screen, and zero problems or hassles at all. Bizarre that Zoom not only requires a separate download but also that its so tricky/conditional to get the same functionality.

Since Zoom's hardware detection is garbage, does anyone have any workarounds or registry hacks that will allow me to force non-green-screen custom backgrounds? Thanks.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/Zoom/comments/i9fkg5/zoom_virtual_background_wo_green_screen_zoom_not/,ericksontx

2020-08-15 22:27:27,"""Please wait for the host to start this meeting""... How do you accept an invitation for a future meeting? I'm struggling, please help","This is my first time using Zoom. I'm a student so some of my professors are having virtual classes.

One of my professors sent out an invitation email a few days ago. It's going to be a reoccurring event, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30 am to 11:00 am. I got my account set up, clicked the link in the invitation, and the box that says ""Please wait for the host to start this meeting."" came up. I thought, okay, so I'll just have to wait until 9:30 Tuesday and then come back and click the invitation link.

But then, last night, the professor sent out another email explaining that ""If you are receiving this email, it means you have not accepted the Zoom invitation yet. Please do that.""

And now I'm terribly confused. I don't know how to accept it without that ""please wait for the host"" box. Am I supposed to just keep Zoom running continuously and not shut down my computer until Tuesday? I have other virtual meetings before that, and I can't go joining another meeting when Zoom is still waiting for this one.

I've tried to find instructions on how to accept invitations for future and reoccurring meetings, but I can't find anything. I thought maybe I have to schedule it on my calendar, but all the scheduling instructions I can find are for creating your own meetings.

2020-08-16 11:11:42,Breakout Rooms with different sizes,"Hello,  I am hosting a meeting for an org I volunteer for. They have a paid acct and use breakout rooms a lot.  


However I was asked if I could do the following configuration.\\:  


N participants overall (we won't know how many till the meeting starts).

X participants in Room x

Y participants in Room y

The rest of the  participants (N - X - Y)  can be spread over the remaining breakout rooms, ideally randomly, but I'm OK assigning them manualy.  


So one set of breakout rooms all with the same number of people in them, and then two more rooms, X and Y, which each have an arbitrary number of people..

Participants will choose if they are team X, team Y or neither after the meeting starts. There is no way to pre-assign this.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this possible? If not, what is the best option? Basically team X and team Y need to be firewalled from the rest of the groups.  I'm thinking worst-case, I and the cohost can login under non-paid accounts and just create  quick and dirty meetings for Team X and Y,  and post the links in the chat.  The breakout discussions won't be more than an hour long, so there won't be a timing problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When hosting meetings or get togethers, we like to have background music streamed at low volume to avoid the silences between conversations. One thing we've noticed is that when using Windows laptops to share audio, the music cuts off when another user speaks on their mic. For example User A (on Windows) is sharing music, when User A speaks, his music is continuous. But when User B or C speak, the music from User A cuts off. When using Mac laptops, this same phenomenon does not occur. When User A on Mac shares music, even when Users A and B talk, the music just continues on without interruption. Any idea how we can avoid this on Windows? How can Macbooks have a different response to this issue?

We have had a handful of users lose their credentials.  Zoom still starts at sign on, but it doesnt sign them into Zoom, because it doesnt have the username/password anymore.  They dont notice this though and keep joining meetings as guests.    

Anyone know why their credentials might have been lost?  We suspect one user signed out and signed in as a different user.  Would that have done it?

2020-08-19 15:57:13,Internal microphone seems to stop working after being on mute?,"I am writing out of pure frustration, with the hope that someone out here in the harsh video conferencing landscape filled with mainly Zoom meetings can help!

So we are having a very frustrating issue at the moment with some Zoom calls. Now it has to be noted that we have seen this issue affecting a few people at random (different devices, different OS, different times).

Problem is, this issue is affecting one specific user, very badly: a high level executive in our company. It seems to be happening more regularly these days, and there is not pattern. Happens at random.

The user will join a Zoom meeting with audio, and all is working fine as it starts. However, after the user is on mute for a while (self-mute, not muted by host. Muting using the in-app mute button in Zoom, not the device shortcuts) when he unmutes, no one can hear him. The microphone button in Zoom is unmuted, and the little green bar moves as he is speaking (so it's picking up his voice) but no one in the call can hear him.

He has to leave and rejoin the meeting and then the microphone is working fine again. This happens in about 3 out of every 10 meetings, but seems to be more regular now. One time at happened 2 times during a (serious!) 1hr30 long meeting.

We have tried to change a few settings and even logged a support case directly with Zoom, but we're at wit's end.

  
Note the laptop is brand new, drivers are all updated, Zoom app is the most recent version, and all Windows updates have been installed. Device is a  Dell XPS 15 7590 , OS is Windows 10 Professional.  
I have checked the microphone privacy settings, and have unchecked any audio enhancements / Exclusive Mode settings recently-  so waiting to see if this issue happens again.

Please tell me someone else experienced this...and what you did to resolve this!

I've reached out to my bank to stop the automatic deductions but it's gonna take a while yet the Zoomites are happily waiting to gobble up my little pennies in less than 12 hours. Y'all thought that was it? I was let go from the job that actually required me to have the Zoom account last month so I'm unemployed.

2020-08-20 06:00:20,Strange issue with audio going in and out,"I've been having an issue with audio over my computer. At this point I just have Zoom call my phone but I'd like to fix it.

When I connect, audio works for about 2 seconds, then cuts out. I can still see the volume indicator on the microphone moving when I talk, but the others don't hear anything. Here's where it gets weird: every 18 seconds (exactly) audio comes back on for about 1-4 seconds, then turns off again. It will repeat this forever.

It happens on my phone as well, but if I switch from Wifi to LTE, it immediately starts working again. On laptop, if I switch wireless from my Asus wireless router the wireless hosted by my modem, it starts working again.

So, something wrong with the wireless router right? I turned on/off the firewall, tried QoS, separated 2.4ghz and 5ghz wireless networks and tried on both, changed my DNS server, sitting a few feet away from the router. The issue doesn't change. This hasn't always happened, I used to be able to join using computer audio on both my phone and laptop. Not sure if an update on my side or zoom's side could cause this.

Does anyone have an idea what could cause audio to cut in and out every 18 seconds is?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/icxgs9/strange_issue_with_audio_going_in_and_out/,Hypnoz

Is there any way to resend an individual invitation to someone in the main room of the Zoom call so they can have the prompt to join the breakout room again? I understand that if someone presses later, there is an option to join the breakout room somewhere in another setting, but accessing this is far too complicated for a 5 year old learning English.

2020-08-24 04:40:58,Using ATEM Mini with Zoom and viewing participants,"Hi there!

I teach photography classes and decided on a 3-input ATEM mini which takes my 3 HDMI sources (two cameras and an iPad video out.  So far it works really well, although I have performance issues with it (will make another post for that).

&amp;#x200B;

Since Zoom sees my 'webcam' as a continuous output from the ATEM MINI, Zoom thinks I just have a simple one camera setup.  Fine by me.  The only negative side effect is that I can't see to coax Zoom to give me a floating participants window. 

This is problematic because the main content window (my broadcast) has the participants above it in one single unified window. The participants are forced into a single line at the top of the window, and can only fit five or six, but I sometimes have up to 10 in the meeting, and I want to see everyone.  I'd love to have the floating window so I can put the participants where it would work best for my window layout. 

Wondering if there is a way to get Zoom to show me a floating participants window even though I (as Zoom sees it) I am not using the share functions - at all.  The ATEM Mini takes away the overly long delays of trying to share things, I can just tap a button to get between my 3 sources.  Works so nice, except for the participants window thing.

2020-08-24 04:47:22,True internet bandwidth requirements? Or is this a CPU issue,"I'm running a Zoom setup with an ATEM mini and do not do any 'sharing' (screens). All of my video sources go through the ATEM which is a switcher, and I am very happy with it. 

My laptop is a Macbook Pro which is five years old with 16GB of ram and 2.7 intel i7.  I try to run zoom without other apps running, except maybe safari from time to time. 

I am on Rogers - an internet provide here which my service is 150 down, 10 up.  I have already arranged to switch to Bell fiber, 1.5gb down, 900 up. 

Thing is, I cant be sure that the bandwidth is the issue. I get severely lagged video from time to time where my sources are super, super laggy.  Sometimes to the point where I am getting just 1 frame every other seconds of my own video.  So I am now running meetings with all webcams off, and still getting (occasional) terrible performance like this.  

I don't know what to do other than having arranged for a different provider, but based on the zoom specs I saw, I thought I was well within speed needed.  But now I dont know anymore. 

I know this isn't much to go on, but would appreciate any advice?  Is my computer too old or outdated? I wouldn't think so. 

If I have left anything out about my setup that would be relevant, please let me know!

I already have a screen locker and user data encryption that protects everything I do on that computer, and duplicating that protection is just redundant and annoying.

Additionally, what psychopath decided to have Zoom reopen after pressing Ctrl+W? If I want it to stay closed, which is what I want to do every single time I close it, I have to either actually click ""Leave meeting"" or press Ctrl+W again after it reopens but before it finishes connecting to the meeting. That behavior is inconsistent with literally every other website in existence, which makes my muscle memory useless. I now have to remember that this particular webpage requires pressing Ctrl+W twice to close it, and if I forget I get thrown right back into the meeting. If I had really accidentally closed the meeting (which has literally never happened), the browser already provides Ctrl+Shift+T to reopen closed things, I'm pretty sure Zoom provides a history of meetings I've been in, and I can just go where I found the link and open it again.

Those behaviors alone make it really infuriating to use Zoom, to the point where I wouldn't if given the choice, and that's not even considering how much of a privacy and security nuclear disaster it is, but unfortunately my school likes using crap so I'm stuck with it. Is there any way to get rid of these behaviors so I can at least remain sane?

Also, who put the reaction buttons in the participants menu? Due to it being named ""Participants,"" one would expect that it contains the actions for viewing and managing participants, which I would say is a reasonable expectation. And yet the reaction buttons, which have nothing to do with viewing and managing participants, are in that menu. Just why? What's wrong with putting a dedicated ""reaction"" button in the large amount of blank space in the bottom panel, since reactions don't really belong in any of the existing menus? Or at the very least why not put them in the chat menu, as both reactions and chat share the similarity of being nonverbal communication?",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/igf9xy/is_there_any_way_to_prevent_zoom_from/,AttackOfTheHack

It normally stays around 250MB for hours, but across 20 min it spiked to GBs of usage, to over 60GBs.. Today I watched it and it worked fine from 8 until noon, then started spiking. Restarting resolves it, but then it happens again later.

2020-08-29 16:57:11,Interesting webinar use case needs clarification,"Just to preface: we’ve been in contact with Zoom support since June and still don’t have 100% clarity on our issue.  

For my job, we host large events with several hundred speakers and a gallery of people watching/listening in. The first time we moved this to zoom, I bought a webinar 500 plan, thinking that would provide our needed 300 panelists and additional space for our attendees. I confirmed with zoom support this would  work (it did not— their support documentation was out of date and the tech person was misinformed). It allowed 100 panelists to join and locked out the other 200 people that had panelist invite links.

Needless to say it was a stressful 3 hours of emailing all 200 of those guests (and fielding their calls) asking them to join via the attendee link, and then manually promoting to panelist/demoting other panelists as needed.

Now we have another event coming up at the end of September and zoom has assured us we won’t have this problem again as long as we purchase both a large meeting (500) and webinar 500 plan— apparently the large meeting license is what determines the # of panelists you can have and the webinar license determines the # of attendees (this is super unclear to me and there is 0 support documentation to back this up). 

We’ve asked if there are any other companies or people using 101+ panelists in a meeting so we can have proof this will work, and if they don’t have an example if they can run a test to prove it. Wanted to ask here if anyone has ever been on or hosted a webinar with 101+ *panelists* or could further support the claim that a large meeting add on is what will fix it.",1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,/r/Zoom/comments/iipayo/interesting_webinar_use_case_needs_clarification/,rchaosdey

Here's what I tried:

* Run the main zoom session on the tablet --&gt; Works for small groups, but fails for large classes where all students have their video on. Also running everything on the tablet is super inconvenient for multitasking slides, a whiteboard, chats, polls, ...
* Run zoom on my desktop PC and use a 2nd zoom account to share my screen from the tablet --&gt; The problem is the screen-share is then overlaid with the tablet camera, not the desktop one (so students look to the ceiling, instead of seeing my video from the front)
* Use Miracast to connect my PC to the surface --&gt; This is the reason why I bought a surface instead of an iPad in the first place. If it would work, this would allow me to use the tablet as external screen for the PC and use its Pen to annotate slides. Unfortunately, the Windows Miracast is super buggy for me and crashes after 1-10minutes...

Initially, I was hoping for an easy way to share my Surface screen, similar to how iPad screens can be shared using the ""share screen"" features.

But when watching the recording, an anonymous user  icon box (white) was placed below my speaker window throughout,.although i was in speaker view. I checked with the participants no one saw that white user icon box in the live session. It looks like it's appearing in the recorded version only.

So why did the white box record although i was in speaker view ? What is this white box ? even if i accidentally set up gallery view why didn't ALL the participants appear in the recording then, just this white box since I had 7 participants? 

 and then how come were participants allowed/able to switch on their video at all anyway ? how can i disable participants from switching on their own video ?? since I can mute/umnute participants permissions for all with regards to audio, how come can't i do the same for video ?

1. If we pre-assign people to the 50 different breakout rooms that represent our 50 teams, could I do an introduction to all attendees before they breakout? Meaning, if they're pre-assigned, do they automatically go to the room when I open up the Zoom call, or is there a button that allows me to ""Open Rooms""
2. We're asking students for their top 2 teams that they want to speak to. They will be pre-assigned to the teams that they want to speak with. So our 50 teams will do their pitch to a first group of students, and then the same pitch to a second ground of different students. Is there a way to pre-assign people into the breakout rooms, and then set a time for the second round of pitches and pre-assign people to different breakout rooms? Emphasis on pre-assign because in normal times, we have 300+ people come to this event and I don't think I can manage re-assigning students in real time before they go to their second choice...

I have several users whose Zoom clients do not show the video preview before joining the meeting. This has created some havoc with some of our lesser computer-savvy users who forget to turn off personal backgrounds/videos. I have tried to replicate the conditions in which the preview DOES show up, but only 2/10 times does it ever show up. The two times it did, it required the users to sign out of their accounts, and log-in to a test meeting, but even then later the video preview did not show up (When attempting to try again). I have also tried every combination of “Video off before joining a meeting”, and “Always show video preview…” Pretty vanilla installs of Zoom, no add-ons, no messing around. This was on 5.1, and then when I saw there was an upgrade, after upgrading to the last 5.2.2, still no dice. I don’t know if this is because of host, or attendee, but it seems trivial for this problem to exist in the first place.

The mouse was able to move freely around the screen, but I couldn’t leave the meeting, the taskbar wouldn’t open at all, I couldn’t close the window, and alt+F4 also didn’t work. Everything was frozen, but the audio was still somewhat functional. It was crackly and kept cutting out. The only thing that worked was holding down the power button and shutting it off completely. 

This all happened with the same meeting within the span of about twenty minutes. 

The first time it happened, I had just left a breakout room. The second time, I had just turned on my webcam (which is required), and the third time it was just fine one second and frozen the next. 

Everything is up do date and I’ve tried reinstalling. I also tried not turning on my webcam to see if that would help. It’s didn’t. 

I joined a fourth time, and the second I noticed the audio was getting a little crackly I went to leave the meeting, and after waiting about twenty seconds, I was successful. Upon leaving the meeting, everything was back to normal, so it’s definitely something with Zoom. 

What can I do about this? These meetings are mandatory so I can’t just not attend them.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/im45fq/zoom_causes_computer_to_lock_up_so_badly_i_had_to/,OriginalSweet
2020-09-04 06:57:51,Is there a better way to share video in Zoom with a higher frame rate than sharing currently does?,"I work in IT at a college and our ASL (American Sign Language) program is having issues with the abysmal frame rate that screen sharing has. When the instructors share signing videos to their online classes it makes it near impossible to make out what people in the video are signing due to it playing at 4 or 5 frames a second. Their work around has been to point the webcam in their class towards the projected video on the wall since it will play fluidly on everyone else's screen (even though it makes the video look washed out). 

I have seen a lot of talk about OBS for this purpose and use it personally use it for things at home, but this is not a solution that will get greenlit to deploy campus wide due to how long it would take to install and configure properly in all of our remote teaching rooms. Also factoring in would be our Faculties' technical abilities to get it up and running, which would more than likely require an IT tech to come and start everything for them. There are too many classes happening concurrently for this to be physically or remotely possible.

So, is there any user friendly, non IT staff intensive methods that can be used to share video with a higher frame rate or are we stuck with the janky looking point the webcam at the screen method until our college finds another method?

TL:DR Screen sharing frame rate for video sucks. OBS is not a viable option. Currently pointing webcams at screens to share videos. Is there a better way?",1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,/r/Zoom/comments/im48z6/is_there_a_better_way_to_share_video_in_zoom_with/,doom_stein

I am preparing to Zoom our in-person meeting (25-30 people) to anyone who wants to join us online. (I have one victim, er..., member interested so far.) We are using the free (40-minute limit) Zoom account, as we have no budget for this. I am using my own personal PC notebook (Lenovo Z70). My first thought was to purchase an inexpensive webcam to use for picture and sound of our in-person audience, but I can't get the microphone to pick up sound through Zoom (the camera works just fine). My second thought was to use my iPad or Samsung phone for the webcam, since either one could join the Zoom meeting without going through my PC. This works fine, but even with the microphone muted, I'm getting the sound picked up and a horrible echo, which makes this solution unusable. Any suggestions for getting a configuration that works? Or should I assume I've promised something I can't deliver. (PS the meeting is this Saturday, September 12.)

2020-09-08 23:50:12,Issue with breakout groups and staying logged in (I’m on Chromebook),"So in one of my classes, the professor has tried unsuccessfully for several class sessions now to put us into preassigned breakout groups. For some reason they just don’t seem to launch, and he’s been forced to put us into random groups every time so far, which doesn’t fit what he’s trying to do. He thinks the issue is that he doesn’t know the email address we’re using for our Zoom accounts, and he needs that to be able to put us in specific groups beforehand, and I’m having trouble figuring out if I may be the issue.

See, my Zoom account has a profile picture, yet every time I join the class, the profile picture disappears. I try to sign in through the Chrome extension app before actually joining, as jumping into the extension from the website seems to sign me out for some reason, but even when I make sure I’m signed in immediately before joining, I still have no profile picture. I don’t know why this is the case, nor can I tell if that means I’ve been signed out or not. I genuinely have no idea how to fix this, or even how to tell if it needs fixing. Would anyone here happen to know what’s going on, if I’m doing something wrong? And if so, how am I supposed to join a Zoom call on a Chromebook while staying logged in to my account?

Here are my thoughts:  

1) put the kids in separate rooms - I would really rather not, if possible.   The kids like being together and same room makes it the whole thing more manageable.

2)  both kids can use a headset.   Yes, but the kids don’t like it and we can’t hear the teacher when there’s a specific instruction the kids are struggling with.

3)  mute one device entirely and both listen through the other device.   This works great until the muted device child gets to unmute and their speech plays through the loud device and feedbacks

2020-09-10 06:04:30,Troubleshooting Preassigned Breakouts (additional help needed),"Does anyone understand preassigned breakout rooms!?

I found a thread about preassigned breakouts in this Reddit, but the ""fix"" within did nothing and I'm still left frustrated and confused.

Let me explain what I'm doing:

\-I am a schoolteacher, in a district that has every student account attached to Zoom. I made a class session with a very large group of students, and scheduled the time for 3:00pm.

\-I take a list of the student's emails, all the same domain, and create the preassigned breakout CSV file. Students told me what breakout room they want to join (their choice) and I make the spreadsheet accordingly. I import the CSV successfully to the Zoom meeting, and when I open the meeting details, I can see my breakouts are there along with students all sorted correctly. It says there are 100 students sorted. Great!

\-At 2:45, or around 10-15 minutes before the meeting, I open up and let students start filing into the room. I admit students who are in the waiting room into the meeting before 3pm, the listed start time.

\-At 3pm or a little while later, when most students have arrived, I click ""Breakout Rooms."" There are all the breakout rooms I created listed... but... most of the students in the call aren't listed. Per advice I read on Reddit and elsewhere, I clicked ""Recreate Rooms"" and hit ""yes."" The first few times, it recognizes and sorts a few more people, but eventually it... stops updating. Out of 100 students, only 50 of them are sorted correctly, no matter how many times I try to refresh. They are listed on the Zoom meeting details, but despite being in the Zoom call, they are not listed under a breakout room within the pop-up window.

\-I hit ""open rooms"" and yep, 50 students are sitting idly under ""unassigned."" I know they're assigned. I can see their emails listed in the breakout room CSV, in the meeting details.

???

Oh my god why is this so hard.

Does it have to do somehow with the start time? Someone mentioned if students come in after the meeting starts (""starts,"" I assume, means ""reaches start time ex. 3pm""), breakout room assignments don't work. Well, I edited the meeting to start later to see if that would help. Nope, breakout rooms stiffen up and stop updating their rosters, even before the listed start time.

Does anyone use this consistently? And how?

&amp;#x200B;

Before anyone suggests the following:

\-The meeting is limited by domain; ONLY students logging into the student email can gain access. So no, students  are not logging into their personal accounts. The emails in the breakout list match the ones they use to log into the meeting.

\-The meeting does not require registration

\-Again, hitting the ""recreate breakout rooms"" does nothing. It's like it locks up and refuses to update. I clicked it and nothing changes.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/ipqa80/troubleshooting_preassigned_breakouts_additional/,khavvah

I had a few hundred registrants for a webinar tomorrow with different questions to get information, but went in and toggled the registration to “optional,” switched it back to “required,” and no longer have access to the registrants. I still have a backup list I downloaded before switching it, but my questions are as follows: 

- Will my previous registrants still be able to access the webinar? (I want to say yes since importing from the report it gave me said “existing registrants not affected,” but wanted to confirm)
-Will I have access to all of the reports and data afterwards with all registrants, or just the ones who have registered after re-enabling required registration? 

Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks, y’all!",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/ipr763/webinar_registration_csv_import/,zatchquill

2020-09-10 14:25:56,How to auto record without host's permission?,"My university has remote lectures through zoom. In my timetable, I have a links to lectures like ""https://liedm.zoom.us..."" to each lecture.

The problem is that the lectures are too slow for me. And I always watch videos online on 2x speed. Sometimes even 3x speed if the speaker speaks really slowly.

I want to auto record the lectures for myself only, so that instead of participating in them live, I can open the video file and play for myself at 2x.

One option is to join the lecture and use a screen recording, BUT during the lecture time I'll be busy using the computer for work, so ideally I'm looking for a software where I could input the zoom link and it would somehow record in the background automatically.

Another possibility could be to rent a VPS and then join the lecture &amp; screen recorder, but I really want this done automatically.

2020-09-12 05:45:34,Breakout rooms set up,"Hello, I’m trying to find the best way to word this but am having a tough time, so please forgive me haha! My church will be hosting our first zoom meeting for a year long class this Tuesday, and we are trying to figure out the best way to set up the breakout rooms. The break out rooms are going to act as “table groups” and each table group has someone who is called a “table shepherd” who more or less just acts as a moderator/guide for the students in that group. The table shepherds join the zoom call the same way other students do and as far as the zoom technology is concerned we are no different than the students. For the first class, unless there is a better way, we plan to set the breakout room selection to “Automatic” where from my understanding is it will divide each participants equally into the number of groups we have. There will be about 35 participants, and 6 table shepherds so there should be 5 students + 1 shepherd per breakout room. Is there any way we can assure that when it is set to automatic, the table shepherds each end up in different breakout rooms? I didn’t think there was, so my best suggestion was to have the 6 shepherds deny the initial invite to the breakout rooms, let Zoom automatically group the students in their rooms, and then have the host go in and manually place/assign the shepherds to each group afterwards. I’m not sure if this will work, and am open to any and all suggestions! Thanks you!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/ir002o/breakout_rooms_set_up/,daydreambeliever13

I noticed some time ago that I tended to feel like crap after Zoom meetings, specifically my ears/head. Seeing as how I have an ear disorder, that isn't foreign to me; but I've come to realize that this seems to happen to people with perfectly healthy hearing also. Zoom audio seems to make my acoustic reflexes go totally haywire. It's a very similar feeling to changes in air pressure, but very very fast, and constant throughout the meeting. Even better- the effects seems to last the rest of the day, OFF Zoom. 

Alternative audio output doesn't make a difference (earphones, speaker, etc.). If I were to guess, this quality issue is caused by the way audio is processed through the program then zapped back out to the meeting, and probably veeeeeeeeery compressed in between. 

I plan to try using the call-in audio when I have a meeting next week; hoping that might help, but I'm concerned that it won't sync correctly.

(She has Zoom premium and probably has some special accessibility settings turned on).

 Are Zoom hosts/moderators able to tell when the Zoom app isn’t the primary window open on your laptop/desktop? If they can, can they see what app/website you're browsing?

And, If they can see everything clearly, is there a way to close or bypass this  setting so that they will not be able to track other apps?

Step 3, use this as your virtual video background and put a stickie note over your camera so you don't show up.

For example, if I try to play a YouTube video or a song from Spotify while I'm connected to a Zoom call, I can't hear the YouTube video or the Spotify song. The only thing my computer will play during a Zoom call is the Zoom audio. This is especially frustrating during lectures if we're expected to watch a YouTube video during the Zoom call, as I'd have to leave the Zoom call in order to actually hear the YouTube video. I can't even adjust the volume of my computer's audio while in a Zoom call, as it doesn't actually change the volume of the Zoom audio (to change Zoom audio, I have to physically use the volume buttons on my earphones).

I have the responsibility at work to host a 100 to 200 person Zoom presentation. The presentation consists of us screensharing a powerpoint which includes short 2ish minute videos every other slide. Predictably, the quality of the video and audio of these video clips is sketchy at best for the viewers. We have made sure we have the best internet speed our side, etc, etc.

I need to figure out a way we can show video clips to the viewers as close to perfect condition as possible. Does anyone know if its possible to live stream a video from a website that can be started and stopped remotely (by us) while people are also watching our zoom feed? For example, we send out a link to a website with our zoom invite. People come onto the zoom call and also have the website open. We do the presentation via zoom, and then when its time to show the video we hit play our end and it streams directly to the users desktop via the website.

Students on Windows machines  are able to see the video play reasonably well with just the occasional delays.  However, students with *Chromebooks* (acers mainly) report the videos do not play well at all.

Is there any known issue with Chromebooks receiving video, and do you know of any actions I can take to fix the issues ?   Perhaps :

&amp;#x200B;

* My settings
* End user settings
* Video quality
* Local video player
* Minimum requirements for end users
* etc...",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/itra5u/problems_sharing_a_local_video_live_to_groups_on/,acolmanj

Besides the finicky tendency that Breakout rooms already has with students who are able to be added to their pre-assigned rooms or not **(usually the root problem there is the way they log in to Zoom to begin with**), a new issue that Zoom support has failed to answer is if there is an actual bug where my pre-assigned cvs file (successfully uploaded) seems to disappear from the class altogether after say 2-4 days? The problem is that if I have faculty members who uploads a file say a week before their next class session, on the day of the session  they see an empty space where the pre-assigned rooms should be after a week has gone by since they were able to upload the file with no errors of any kind. Has anyone encountered this?

I just moved into a mid-century modern house that has mostly glass floor to ceiling walls -- and very high ceilings. Which is beautiful, but also means that I have a ton of background light from daylight. And, as you no doubt know, it's generally a best practice to have your light source in front of you, not behind you on web conferences. In this house, that's not really an option for me. So, I think I have two choices: invest in thousands of dollars of custom drapes, or, my preference, find a light source that can be positioned in front of me so that I am better lit for Zoom meetings. So, with that context in mind, any recommendations on what to look for in a right light or other lighting rig that could:

* Better light me from the front
* Not be super reflective in my glasses 
* Can easily be re positioned on horizontal and vertical 
* Be under $100

This happens even if nothing is changed during the edit. It also does not appear to happen all of the time, but I have been unsuccessful in determining a cause.

2020-09-19 05:45:07,Zoom update broke precious one-click spotlight video feature! (v5.2.2),"I’m concerned about a feature lost in the last update v 5.2.2.

I did the update a few days ago and I realize this version makes almost impossible to switch between panelists quick as always. It used to be 1 click, just ""spotlight video"" and done.

Now is at least a 2 step process= “remove spot light video” then select spotlight or “add to spotlight” + “remove spotlight”. Both in meetings and webinars.

I ended up downgrading to version 5.2.1 In order to keep the valuable spotlight feature.

I contacted Zoom and they told me:

*""This is how they have decided to have it designed. But I will be sure to share your feedback on the feature and that you downgraded to go back to old functionality.  The host can't control the view of the participants. The participants can pick their view just as the host can. The host only controls the view when they are sharing their screen""*

IMHO the whole approach doesn't make sense either for enterprise/corporate communications or even schools. As a hosts, want to tell a story... we want to redirect content/speakers in a meeting or webinar. We don't want auto switching, we want to spotlight someone's virtual camera in order to show a word-cloud etc. Giving the user total control of up to 9 spotlights will mess up with communications flow. Is like watching a TV news show and the audience focusing on the colorful roof lights in the middle of a breaking news. An audiovisual event needs a camera director with full control!

If you find this feature important, please write to them to put back that important one click feature.

Thanks!!!

I had to buy an external mic for zoom, as I was previously using my headphones / computer audio as mic and speaker, but those headphones went caput. 

I was on a non-professional zoom call with one other person, and when they were distracted / away, I was scrolling through Reddit. They keep on hearing things I couldn't, and I eventually figured out that they were hearing videos that were auto-playing as I was scrolling through Reddit, even though I couldn't.

I messed around switching through all of my mic / speaker options, and they could still hear the videos being auto-played, even though I couldn't.

I also tried recreating the problem on other platforms - i.e., I played a Youtube video - but they only seemed to be able to hear the audio of auto-playing videos.

My zoom was never in screen share / audio share mode, which would easily explain it. My speakers are my headphones (and I couldn't hear the videos), so I'm not sure why they'd be able to hear. There was no audio playing from my computer to be picked up by the external mic.

Of course, I guess the easiest solution is to not browse through Reddit and / or mute myself, but this seems to be a pretty weird problem. Anyone have any ideas?

This morning I saw that there was a flatpak version.

After removing the RPM version and installing the flatpak version I started the application.

It was larger than the RPM version and would not let me adjust the size of the window. I had this occur before and the fix was to adjust the value of the scaleFactor variable from 1 to 0 in the zoomus.conf file.

Unfortunately that did not work. I found more than one of these, and as many different iterations I tried (on both files), nothing worked.

I uninstalled the flatpak version and went back to the RPM version and adjusted the zoomus.conf file as mentioned above and all is working as it should.

I want to use the flatpak version. Has anyone else experienced this and did you find a way to fix it?

On Zoom, both the Zoom recording and what people saw was just my Spotlighted view - an image of me on the camera. But on Facebook Live, whenever I switched to Gallery View, Gallery View is also what showed on Facebook.

2020-09-21 01:18:50,Splitting cameras onto 2-3 monitors?,"I teach Tai Chi through Zoom (I have a Pro account). Say I have 16 students + me. I'd like to either:

\* put my camera onto my laptop's screen PLUS put 16 caller's cameras onto an external monitor (31.5"")

OR

\* put my camera onto the laptop screen PLUS put 8 caller's cameras on one external monitor AND 8 more caller's cameras onto a second external monitor.

Is this possible with Zoom?

The reason for this is since my tai chi classes are now virtual, I still want to be able to see the movements of my students. Typically, my back faces the camera, but I will turn my head left or right to see the students' movements behind me and this way I can give custom feedback to each student. Having two large external monitors will help a lot to be able to see the student's bodies well enough, as I stand several feet away from the monitors (to keep them out of the line of sight of my webcam).

Thanks for any advice you have. I contacted Zoom about this as well, but I know their customer service team is pretty dang busy these days.

EDIT: As soon as I sent a web request to Zoom, they immediately closed my ticket. As a Pro user, they do not offer chat or phone support, only web. So my only way to contact Zoom is closed the moment I send a request, very frustrating.

So I'm hoping the lovely world of Reddit can. 

SO. I am a GTA for a professor, and he wants to be able to start breakout rooms and have his GTAs (there's three of us in every class) move between breakout rooms. In order to do this he made us all alternative hosts. However, last week we tried this and only one of the GTAs was able to move between rooms. The other two of us could only leave the room we were assigned and return to the main room. 

Is there any way to allow all three of us to go between different rooms?

For the most part it works great but occasionally a Room will join the meeting and immediate disconnect/reconnect (“Reason: Network Connection error”). Sometimes this happens 3-4 times in a row and finally hangs without being able to rejoin at all. (We can get it going again by moving the meeting start time to about 2min away and restarting the app). 

Being a really small IT team for a large organization we aren’t always available to do this and it gets pretty frustrating for everyone involved.  

Just wondering if anyone has seen anything like this. It feels very random. Different recurring meetings at different times a day will work one day but not the next. Different Rooms etc... ticket already submitted to Zoom with no movement.

2020-09-24 00:26:21,How does your Org handle Zoom support in-house?,"If you work in an Org that regularly hosts large meetings (300+) or Webinars with Zoom: 

Does your internal IT staff take part in the scheduling, running, moderating or acting as an overall Producer of the live event? 

As a ""Producer"" what is the IT person's responsibility and role before and during the meeting?

Does an IT staff member sit in on every large Zoom meeting/event even though that takes them away from their other duties?

**There may be a chance for me to get a pay bump if I take a more hands-on role in regards to running and moderating live events hosted by departments in my org.**

**Anyone in a similar situation?**

Some background:

* I work IT in Higher Ed, specifically  Internal IT for one College at a University. 
   * My University's Central IT already provides and fully supports Blackboard Collaborate for instruction and MS Teams for meetings.
   * Despite this, my College's faculty and staff hemmed and hawed that they HAD to have Zoom, JUST HAD TO HAVE IT!
   * My College's Dean told our IT Director to go ahead. 
   * Our IT director did, but made it clear that: 
      * Internal IT still recommends the University services. 
      * Zoom support would be limited to the absolute basics of helping end user host a meeting.
      * There would be no options for added features like Webinar or more storage.
   * I now manage the users on the Zoom account.
   * Haven't had any issues with normal meetings, but now big events with ""High profile"" guests are being planned with little to no planning on the fac/staff's part.
      * They seem to think someone from IT will be on hand for their entire event to ""Produce"" it and handle everything for them.
      * Director said ""No...that's not what we said""
      * **But change of more money if I volunteer to take on that role...**
      * **Worth it? Or too much aggravation on top of my day-to-day duties (Supporting classroom AV/IT)**",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/iydeq8/how_does_your_org_handle_zoom_support_inhouse/,abacus_admin

The default way to registration would have them receive multiple emails with their unique links for each Webinar room. Which will get spammy and people are bound to lose their links. 

I'd like some way to give them **one document/email** with all their links to make it easier on them. (or better yet, one URL that allows them to go to any room they want)

Easiest option would be to provide the base urls, passcode protect them, and send them everything in one document. But this would allows for Zoom bombing by people sharing the code. 

I'm thinking if I can get a list of their unique URLs (each user has their own 'tk' value) I can just run them through a document maker and send them that, but outside of pulling them out one by one from their confirmation email, I can't find how to do it.

1. If someone schedules a meeting without a license but is then given a license before starting the meeting, will that meeting be using the license and thus not have a time limit for more than 2 participants?  

2. If a user is already in a meeting with more than two participants and has the 40 min time limit associated with it, if I apply a license to the account of the host who is currently in the meeting, does that meeting see the newly applied license and no longer have a time limit?

3. Is there any way to set a time and date for a license to be reclaimed automatically (set user back to basic) when we give them a license to use?  

We have been trying to shuffle just a handful of licenses around to people on an as needed basis since most people tend to only need 1 to 1 meetings most of the time. It has been working out fine but requires a lot of administration time. It would be nice if some of it could be automated.

I know how to make this happen without the presenter view layer, but I need to give my presentation using my specific script for easy closed captioning purposes.

I went to Zoom settings and checked Dual screen and share screen 2 (where the presentation is), but now for whatever reason with dual screen selected it does not let me get that nice movable and sizable minimized recording of myself to.

""The meeting requires registration to join and it is not supported to join from the browser.

This is a bogus message, because I already joined, and got a ""secret"" URL with the code in it. What else do I need to join?

Another questions is: Why doesn't this message auto-launch the Zoom client? Other Zoom meetings' pages do offer to launch the client, but this one doesn't.

After research, I learned I needed to install ishowu to capture the sound... which I did the other day.

The only issue is, I STILL CANNOT CAPTURE my Zoom audio.

Is someone here willing to help walk me through what may or may not be going wrong? I apologize if my post doesn’t have enough info, but at this point my brain is fried... please ask questions if you need specifics. I’d be happy to answer them.

2020-10-04 05:50:06,Help me make my fiancés dance lessons more seamless! Music over Zoom questions.,"Hello! Trying to help her create a more seamless setup to make life easier. 

During these times, she is teaching dance classes remotely over Zoom with her students. Right now, she is doing the following : 

- Another user (the dance school) hosts the meeting
- iPhone on a tripod for camera and microphone
- Macbook signed in as well to see her students 
- iPad to play music in the background (pausing and playing at various intervals)

The music in the background is obviously pretty low in quality, as the microphone from the iPhone is relying on picking up the audio. I know there is an option to use original audio, which would help. Is there any way, with this kind of setup, to have the music go through with the microphone simultaneously?",1.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,/r/Zoom/comments/j4nh8u/help_me_make_my_fiancés_dance_lessons_more/,BaggySpandex

Phone is positioned above a painting placed flat on a table, looking down at the painting, and the Android screen shows landscape orientation.

I'm ""the audio guy"" and have a 4-channel USB audio interface (Behringer UMC404HD) which is enough to handle the mics we need.

I guess my computer will probably be the assigned speaker, and I'll point my USB camera at the speaker or piano, whichever is performing at the time.  That's easy enough to see what video I'm sending.

How best can I monitor my own outgoing audio levels?  Zoom has no input level indicators other than in the ""Test Mic"" mode under Preferences, at least that I know of.

I assume that Zoom is doing a lot to adjust what I send it, but I'd like to be able to monitor live (in my headphones) as well as have a meter of some sort to make sure I'm sending in a strong audio signal without overdriving and clipping.

My audio interface only has ""signal"" and ""clip"" LEDs, which are better than nothing but I'd like a bit more resolution, as well has HEAR what's going out.",1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,/r/Zoom/comments/j58wz7/monitoring_outgoing_audio/,pivap

2020-10-06 23:24:58,Diagnostic and testing with free/paid accounts at a specific site,"Hey all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been chasing my tail for a client in the last few weeks with a really specific issue between paid and free accounts being able to START hosting a meeting.  I've got a ticket open with zoom, but I am curious to see if others have witnessed this.  Either way, I'll be documenting the problem solving path and steps here.

&amp;#x200B;

* Intro to issue was suddenly people in the office said they couldn't start a zoom meeting (  104114  )
* I connected to a test computer with my (paid) account, and it worked fine
* Went down the rabbit hole on their computer to see what was happening.  Tried swapping between my paid account and their free, and it was identified that the free account just wouldn't be able to START a meeting, but can JOIN any external meeting without issue
* Checked all the domain rules, firewall rules, firewall apps, removed them all from the mix, same issues
* did a complete hard restart of all network devices
* tested wired and wireless, same results between both account types
* On a different site (aka my office) their free account connects and starts a meeting just fine

&amp;#x200B;

Where I think this is going so far:

&amp;#x200B;

* There is a bad network setting rule that I have yet to discover when hosting a meeting, and only free accounts use some of the ports identified 
* The ISP is throttling some of these ports / traffic 
* Zoom is throttling this IP for the client AND the free account in combination due to abuse/extreme load/some other reason
* ????

Happy to share more data, and as noted, will be following up as I figure it out.  I am certainly tired of hearing about this error and being told it's just another setting, when I've poured over it at only one office of hundred for hours and hours.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/j670r1/diagnostic_and_testing_with_freepaid_accounts_at/,browndizzle

2020-10-07 02:16:34,Help with Multiple Account Management through Zoom,"Hello,

Whenever I hit a zoom link for my college courses I am taking at my UC the zoom account I log into seems to go at random...  I'll be logged into my UC's course website account with my username, I'll click the posted zoom link and it'll pick up on my 'Work' account and log me on under that email instead of my student account.  

The big issue is that I tutor at the local JC and am getting logged into that account which I have my name set as Tutor: My name, to differentiate my self from students in the course I tutor.  It is frustrating, and honestly kind of embarrassing when the label appears during a course I am definitely not tutoring...  

Is there a way to be sure to be signed in under a specific account prior to entering zoom lectures?  This is kind of driving me crazy and I don't have an easy way to trial and error solutions because my professor only has us log into zoom for class discussion.

My browser is chrome, and I'm working off of a surface pro currently.  My Work account is Confer zoom.  The Student is a regular Zoom account through my university.

The setup is this: a USB mixer is used to combine the teacher's voice and the music and fed into Zoom by selecting the interface as the mic in Zoom settings. The reasoning behind the mixer is that the music and voiced are perfectly synced.

The music is played from an Ipad via the headphone jack, split via a Y-adapter and sent both to the mixer for the Zoom feed and to an external speaker so the teacher can hear the music. The students' voices are heard through the usual Zoom audio.

The mic is a pro-grade wireless lavalier.

The music sounds fine on the monitor. The mic sounds spectacular from the students' perspectives. But, the music into Zoom? Huge problems. 

The music sounds to the students like it's being run through broken processing. It got some weird flanging properties, drop-outs, clipping-like distortion. All the recommended settings for music quality are being used for Zoom and original sound is turned on.  The gain structure from the iPad through the mixer to Zoom is well balanced and should not be clipping.  I have tried the same setup using a different computer and have had the same results.

If this person was to go to a different computer and use their account, they can join a meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is, this user will click on a meeting link and zoom will launch and do it's thing. But when it actually tries connecting to the meeting, it wont go anywhere. The screen just gets stuck at ""Connecting"" indefinitely. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling (Which by the way, manually installing the client before a meeting results in the Zoom app not showing up as a runnable program and thus does not launch at all.)

I've tried doing several scans on the computer for maybe corrupt files and found nothing.

I've tried probably everything I can think of and still, the zoom client gets stuck at ""connecting"" no matter what when run under this particular users context on one particular machine. Any tips?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/j6w4f9/one_user_on_one_computer_cannot_connect_to_any/,Mailstorm

This means that they are unable to join breakout rooms which are essential to our meeting. It's a recur anytime meeting, and they are using the Zoom app.

This is only ever an issue for this one participant. They have :

- ensured Zoom is up to date
- tried on two different devices (an iPad mini which is admittedly maybe too old and a new smartphone)
- downloaded and reinstalled Zoom on both
- left the meeting and tried again
- joined the meeting using ID and password as opposed to link
- logged out of their Zoom account entirely and joined as a 'guest'
- been through all of the meeting options offered on screen and read them out to me
- I've assigned them to a different room

I use Zoom for private tutoring, and for one of my students, we usually start our calls by doing a direct video call (usually her to me, but sometimes me to her) from the ""Contacts"" section of the zoom app. In these calls, she can share her screen, and I can annotate on it, which is very helpful for modeling how to solve certain math problems. However, with my other student, I start my personal meeting room, and send him the ID and password for my meeting via text, and then admit him from the lobby when he joins. (I believe he is accessing Zoom from a school-issued Chromebook if that makes a difference.) He shares his screen so that I can see what he's working on, but when I go to the same menu location at the top that I do for my other student, the annotate option is not there.

But the actual meeting link kept asking for a host key, when we are not the host. We entered the SIP address and the passcode, it connects then asks for a host key. 

I've done a meeting via our boardroom with this company before and it worked fine by just entering SIP address and passcode. 

I've concluded that issue comes from way the webinar was scheduled/hosted? Is there a way where the host could accidentaly make the system think that particpants are hosts as well?

My work computer recently crapped the bed, and so I've been using my personal computer for work (terrible I know, but what can you do...)

My work computer was a chromebook. On my chromebook, I was able to use the copy and paste function in Zoom chat. This is critical to the work I do, because I use Zoom calls to sign people up for events. Part of how I sign them up is by asking them to type their full name and email into the chat box, which I then copy over to my own document.

However, when I tried to do this today on my personal computer, I discovered that the ability to copy and paste no longer exists. CTRL + C doesn't work, right clicking doesn't work, nothing works. My personal computer is a Dell running Windows.

So, r/Zoom, what gives? Do Windows PCs just get the short-end of the stick? It blows my mind that a feature as essential as copy and paste would only work on some devices. Does anyone have a fix to use Copy and Paste in Zoom calls on my PC? I need to do it at a moment's notice, so pulling the chat history after the fact won't work.

I really can't keep writing information down and transferring it over one person at a time, especially since I have dozens of people on these Zoom calls and I need to plug their information into my database in real time. This has thrown a serious wrench into my established workflow.

USE CASE: presenting online via Zoom: shared screen, my video, audio, gallery view, virtual background, and sometimes video playback from my machine screen shared.  


CONSIDERING - PROCESSORS (no dedicated graphics cards - leaning towards the Ryzen)

\-Intel i5-10210u - quad core @ 1.6GHz (boost to 4.2)

\-Intel i5-1035G1 - quad core @ 1.0 GHz (boost to 3.6)

\-Intel i7-10510u - quad core@ 1.8 GHz (boost to 4.9)

\-AMD Ryzen 4500U - 6 core @ 2.3GHz (boost to 4.0)

\-AMD Ryzen 4700U - 8 core @ 2.0GHz (boost to 4.1)

&amp;#x200B;

CONSIDERING - RAM:

\-At least 16GB of DDR4 (so 3200MHz). 

\-Would more RAM be needed?

&amp;#x200B;

FORM FACTOR: 

\-Touchscreen device, likely 2-in-1, as I need the portability.

\-Likely will be either the Lenovo Flex 14 or the HP Envy x360 13 or 15.

&amp;#x200B;

**I'll spend the money if I need to, but don't want to overbuy on specs.** 

* **Are all of these sufficient processors to be a power-user of Zoom without getting the low resource warning/poor Zoom performance?**
* Is RAM more important than CPU? (for example, I can get a 32GB RAM DDR4 system with Intel i5-10210 for about the same price as a 16GB RAM DDR4 system with AMD 4700U)
* Would a more budget system work: i5-1035G1 with 16GB DDR4 RAM?
* **Does Zoom even use more than one thread?**

&amp;#x200B;

WHY I'M GETTING A NEW MACHINE:

I've been getting low resource warnings on both my machines (although worse with the Surface Pro 4). My machines are:

\- Dell Precision M4800 Mobile Workstation: Win10Pro, Quad Core i7-4800MQ at 2.7 GHz boost to 3.7, AMD FirePro M5100 graphics card with 2GB, 16GB of DDR3L RAM, Dual Band Wireless-AC.

We didn't meet for a couple weeks but then last night we got back together and I could not stream us to Facebook. I kept getting an error message that said 'you do not have permission to live stream (200)."" Previously there was never a problem. The head of our group would start the meeting then make me the host and I would take care of the live streaming. I couldn't do it last night and let everyone down.

2020-10-12 05:53:06,"Zoom Meeting Organizer: Browser Extension to organize, join, schedule your meetings","I made a browser extension to organize all of my Zoom classes in one place after being tired of continuously going to each individual teacher's posting to find it. This extension doesn't just keep all of your meetings stored, but ***automatically organizes*** them in order of which is coming up next (or A-Z if you choose). You should never even have to scroll to join your next meeting. It will be there right on top as soon as you click the extension. *Joining your meeting* is simple. Click the button and bam, your meeting opens up with all of the information about the meeting (meeting id, password, and your meeting username (for example: if you want to have a different Spanish username for your Spanish class). And don't worry, none of this information ever exits your computer (no server communication).

To simplify the process of adding Zoom meetings, there is an ***autofill feature***. How does it work? You simply go to the Zoom Meeting URL in a browser tab, open the extension, and voila...it autofills the meeting id and password. 

This extension has been tested on *various browsers*: Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. This extension properly accommodates for *various operating systems*: Windows, macOS, and even chrome os (for Chromebooks). 

An option for ***notifications*** is also provided with custom time setting. When the notification pops up, all you have to do is simply click it, and it will automatically open your meeting up. 

I've even recently expanded this to *support meetings on other platforms* as long as you have the meeting link.  

My goal is to help simplify and help as many people as possible. If you have any suggestions or feedback of any kind, feel free to let me know! I will try to implement them as efficiently as possible.

Not sure if anyone has a solution for this unique problem.

My 2 kids having zoom class every morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Only one Kid having a zoom class issue. His class is disconnected every 2-3 mins. I contact the school and the Internet will get the disconnect. So I increase speed from 25 Mbps to 200 Mbps. Still the same issue.

I talk to the school and explain the situation they said to come and change the Chromebook. I change Chromebook 3 times still the same issue.

I try to connect his zoom meeting from different devices still the same issue and disconnecting from the internet and wi-fi icon say no internet. I connect with a hard ethernet cable and showing good speed but still the same issue.

I change my Modem still the same issue. I got Xfinity/Comcast modem with router still the same issue.

Again I increase speed from 200 Mbps to 600 Mbps and my laptop and another device have more than 300 Mbps speed including my both kid's Chromebook has more than 300 Mbps speed, still the same issue. I call to Xfinity/Comcast technician to come and visit my home and check the internet, every thing looks good he test speed with his device and was showing good speed. But Zoom class having the same issue.

I log in to his zoom class from my iPhone and use the data plan and not using any wi-fi but still the same issue.

Again this is only one kid's zoom class having an issue even he can open youtube and no issue with the internet disconnectivity. Another kid having no issue with zoom.

Then I thought might be the internet get fluctuated and kick out him from zoom class. So I get another internet connection from AT&amp;T provider. Now I have two internet providers one is existing from Comcast/Xfinity and another from AT&amp;T, And I connect with AT&amp;T internet service using wi-fi or hard ethernet cable still having the same issue.

Last I tried to connect zoom with Xfinity internet provider and AT&amp;T internet provider with two different devices still zoom class is disconnected both at the same time. So I think there is not an internet issue because both devices get disconnected from the zoom class.

Does anyone have this kind of issue or solution?

NOW CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHERE SHOULD I HAVE TO FIX THIS ZOOM ISSUE?

Also, It also kept us sane during quarantine.

We did 10 episodes using only Zoom to record, bouncing between full screen and gallery view. It was a lot of fun and I think it came out at least okay.  The (few) people that have checked it out so far seem to really like it. The editors really did all the magic.

I think the biggest challenges were video quality since we wanted to stick to zoom 100%. It was also fun to try to keep it interesting since we were restricted to sitting in our zoom boxes.

If anyone has any crazy zoom specific work interactions I""d love to hear them, because we're considering doing a season 2.

2020-10-14 00:09:19,Tech Support: Language Interpretation in Webinars,"Hi all, I submitted a ticket to Zoom but might have a quicker response in the subreddit so wanted to post here:

I experienced issues with language interpretation on a work webinar. On the back-end, I had invited two language interpreters for two languages, Russian and a custom language (Uzbek). We had approximately 8 other panelists joining the call.

The interpreters joined via the unique invite link sent to them when I assigned them as interpreters. When they joined the webinar (which we started as a practice session), they were not automatically assigned. The panelists joined via one panelist link that we had created off of one invitee - therefore, all panelists joined initially as that one email address. However, we believed the workaround to this was to simply rename them.

When I manually assigned the language interpretations to the interpreters, multiple panelists (to no particular logic - it appeared random) were also assigned as interpreters - meaning they were only able to speak on the interpretation channels, despite being panelists. This included our moderator for the event, which posed a number of issues. We were unable to remove them as interpreters while also keeping our actual interpreters on in the language channels. We ended up having to turn off interpretation for the entire webinar.

I would like to prevent this in the future - do you have any theories on how this issue occurred and what steps I can take to ensure this issue will not be a problem in the future? Thanks!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jagige/tech_support_language_interpretation_in_webinars/,hummusguy12
2020-10-14 00:10:59,Zoom for iOS always reloads previous meeting,"Hi,

I'm a bit stumped on this one. I'm an Android guy but I'm trying to help my mom out with this. She's a tutor and has to attend Zoom meetings of the classes that her students are in. She goes by a master Google doc with each teacher's permanent Zoom link.

Basically, every time she clicks any Zoom link from that list, regardless of which one, it takes her to the previous meeting. Then the teachers get an email that she is in the waiting room even though it is not time for that meeting.

I suspect what is happening is that when she clicks the link, instead of launching Zoom directly, it launches Safari, which attempts to reload the last page, which was the other Zoom link...?

Further evidence is that when she just opened Safari on its own (not to enter a Zoom meeting), Safari immediately reloaded the last visited page (a Zoom link) and launched Zoom with that earlier meeting.

Does anyone have a clue how to fix this? I don't live near her and I don't have an iPhone, so basically I'm just guessing and trying to explain over the phone, which so far has not worked.

But the teacher still says she was not on the call, and my daughter says they had the same issue where she tried to talk to her to tell her she was there and the teacher didn't hear her and marked her as absent. She's in these calls. She is unmute-ing to speak so that's not the issue, as her teacher and her friend both say they didn't see her on the call. 

So what is going on? I've been googling and haven't seen this issue anywhere. Could it be something on my daughter's end or on her end? Has anyone ever had this problem? And how can we resolve it? It's not really fair to my daughter to be marked absent on these calls when she was on them.

2020-10-14 11:11:10,Recording-playback echo for audience in Zoom,"I just got the free version of Zoom for an upcoming webinar for clients at work where I have to present a project for the length of 1 hr. We have the option of either playing a recorded presentation or do a live one before the Live Q&amp;A session. I seriously want to do a recorded playback because I am not a good speaker and get to the point of getting anxiety phases. 

Now, I have tested recording a video and playing it in a meeting with two colleagues. The one thing both of them are complaining about is that they hear echo and my voice is sounding like a robot in the playback, but sounds absolutely fine when I just speak in the call. I have tested it myself using my work &amp; personal computer and it is true, there is horrible echo and robot-voice sound. 

After severe testing, I found the cause of the echo was my headphones being plugged in the computer during the playback. When I unplug the headphones, I or the user can hear it as normal. 

Does anyone know of any setting which can help resolve this issue? I have tried using airpods, different headset, messing with the Zoom app's audio settings, but nothing is working. I set the ""Echo Cancellation"" setting to ""Agressive"" and both the speakers and Mic are set to my headphone, but nothing. If anyone can please guide me, that will be really helpful.

2020-10-15 12:12:34,Workaround to let alt hosts run several concurrent meetings?,"Hello! I'm writing with some panic and desperation - hopefully someone here can offer a workaround of some sort! I created several recurring Zoom meetings and assigned several people as alternative hosts, with the plan to have several meetings happening at the same time. I thought that even though I'm the owner/host, the alt hosts could start and run the meetings at the same time. Now, I found out the hard way that a Zoom Pro license only allows you to run two(?) concurrent meetings, even if you have alternative hosts and they have Pro licenses.

What's odd is that after fifteen minutes of alt hosts and myself trying to start meetings and getting the ""the host in running another meeting - do you want to close the meeting?"" error, eventually alt hosts got into each of the four meetings, one by one. They were then able to run them normally, and I was able to hop in and out of the rooms. So somehow, the limit of two concurrent meetings was flexible - but we weren't able to figure out what the magic recipe was.

We have another similar event coming up the day after tomorrow, and I obviously don't want to repeat the chaos. However, we've already advertised the URLs widely and have no easy way to notify people who plan to attend. In other words, I can't simply create new meetings, but I need to find a workaround instead.

Any ideas? I'm in a university, but our IT dept seems flummoxed by the whole issue - in other words, I can probably get a Zoom license upgrade or whatever is needed, but I need to be able to tell our IT dept what they need to do.

2020-10-15 13:19:10,Zoom bumps up my audio to max level randomly while screensharing then corrupts settings,"Hello!  Trying to save my ears here....

I'm having an issue where zoom changes my audio to max volume while screensharing.  What's more, I'm using it to share a for video editing and it's corrupting my editing software (Avid Media Composer) and system settings to the point that it's happening even when zoom is not open.  The volume bumps up to max at random times, blasting my ears and making me jump.

It seems like the corruption happens on either first time opening of zoom or first time screen sharing but sometimes it's not right away (it's very inconsistent).  A fix has been to delete and re-make all editing settings.  This is a bit of a pain and it also only fixes the problem until I need to use zoom again.  Anyone else, editor or not, had any issues like this?  Anyone know who to contact?  My IT department has gone through troubleshooting but without any outcome besides what I've mentioned.

I'm trying to find a solution so I don't damage my hearing since I'm only able to use headphones at the moment.  I've tried looking for ""max audio limiting"" options as well but am concerned about giving 3rd party programs audio control and how that will affect zoom/editing software.

I have a kind of weird problem on a windows PC. In a call it doesnt load the big focussed  video. When I start a call the screen starts black. I get it to update when I switch to fullscreen and back but then it still doesnt show a video but pretty much a screenshot of the video at the moment I entered fullscreen. Also when I end the call right before the window disappears it shows everything as it should but probaply also just a photo and no video. When Im in a call with another person the small video is shown as it should be. I can kind of make a video disappear by pinning it. Then the other video is small and fine but the pinned one isnt there anymore. I have no clue what the problem could be. Did anyone face an error like that before? Could it be because of the GPU?

2020-10-16 16:10:09,Do non-hosts have restrictions?,"Hi everyone. I'm totally new to zoom. I have a question regarding the meeting limitations.

A little background information first. I work for the government in an EU country and we normally use webex as video conferencing system, but the issue is that webex is a heavily protected online environment that has been specifically developed for us, which means external partners have no access to it. This is especially troublesome because we live in a time where trainings are being given virtually and as things stand, our external partners can't give my employees trainings since they have no way to use our systems. 

Which is fine, because there's zoom that we can install on our iPads. However, just want to know what I can expect if I don't get a paid license for the employees attending a one-time training. Obviously, I don't suddenly want to find them all kicked out of the meeting room after 40 minutes. However, as you can imagine, getting 60+ licenses just for a one-time virtual training is something we'd rather avoid as well.

So my question being: Is necessary for a non-host to get a paid license in order to to surpass the limitations of 40 minutes and 3 members per meeting? Or does only the host need to have a pro/paid license?

Hopefully someone can help me out! Would greatly appreciate it! :-)",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jc5yw7/do_nonhosts_have_restrictions/,xmyrcellax

My wife has to manage a Zoom meeting for 1000 people and around 40 breakout rooms. Each breakout room has two specific people that need to be in the room, and it doesn't matter who the other people in the room are.

Last time she managed this event, she was having issues with the rooms being filled before the two specific people who were supposed to be in each room had joined. I believe she was also manually assigning the remaining people to the rooms (about 920 of them...).

I was under the impression that my wife could pre-assign the two specific people who are supposed to be in each breakout room, and then auto-assign the other people who join. Am I wrong in thinking this? Is there a possibility the rooms could be filled before the two specific people who are supposed to be in each breakout room join the meeting?

Also, is there a way to lock which room the auto-assigned people are in once they have joined a room? So for example, if they get disconnected and rejoin, they will go back to the room they were in before?

2020-10-21 08:55:08,The GhostedEye—How to look at the other person and the camera at the same time,"The Ghostedeye

I did this as a DIY project back in April. It's sort of a reverse periscope that hangs on your desktop monitor, creating a Pepper's ghost ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s\_ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost) ) that aligns the person's face with your monitor's camera during video sessions. 

Anyone can make it themselves using reasonably common items. I'd recommend watching the video at least twice to make sense of it. 

[https://youtu.be/Hce7tJT0LAo](https://youtu.be/Hce7tJT0LAo)

Use it on video meetings. You'll see the person's face AND the camera at the same time. Without it, you'll appear—on their end—like you're looking away from them. It's hard to explain, but once you see it, it'll make total sense. 

Paint it, or leave it unpainted. Paint really isn't needed, though : the other person never sees it and never knows it's there. If you want to paint it, though, go ahead!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jf2tm7/the_ghostedeyehow_to_look_at_the_other_person_and/,d0ugparker

The idea came to us in the spring of 2020 when we realized that the pandemic would radically change the way we network. Here are some features:

\* Automated randomized match making per round

\* No manual assignments of attendees

\* Business card exchange, just like in real world

\* A defined length per each round. Optionally with an overall hard time break

\* Everyone is talking to everyone privately. No group chats!

\* No other software required. Just your regular browser

We have been using Zoom quite a lot since lockdown, and it's been working great. We love the breakout rooms feature, but we are starting to have a few problems with it. Once we have assigned everyone in they're rooms, and to on Share Screen from the lobby, only certain ones in the room can share their screen. We have only noticed this to be an issue in the last 2 weeks. There could be 2-4 people in a breakout room, but maybe only 1 or 2 people can share screen. If others try to share their screen in the room, they get the message ""The Host had Disabled Screen Share"" which we obviously haven't as other people in the room can share their screen. We have tried changing the ""Advanced  Sharing Options"" but that does fix it.

Basically, when he shares his screen, my audio echos. But only I hear the echo (my boyfriend does not). My audio reverbs everything, but it's only when he screen shares. When I screen share there is no reverb, and when we aren't on screen share there is no reverb. His audio is fine.

2020-10-22 12:08:01,Serious Concern about Zoom!!!,"So, speaking to a professor today after class, I've heard professors can view the student's ""private messages."" So much for privacy! This isn't only a major invasion of privacy this is unethical, and professors/faculty have not said a word, and students ought to have an apology!

Another student and I are sending an email to the dean about the issue and we will be hearing back soon enough. 

This is not an unwarranted suspicion. On multiple occasions, I was private messaging another student for a couple of classes, critical of the professors teaching methods. Lo and behold the next day we were unable to send each other messages through the private messaging option on zoom. I asked other students if they've had an issue with it that same day, and they've replied that there was no problem. The two of us were deprived of our ""private messaging"" privileges because the professor was viewing our conversation. 

Fortunately for myself, I was never immoral in any of these conversations. However, I cannot say the same for the hundreds of other students who were also deprived of their privileges with professors/faculty viewing conversations. 

How does any of this even happen? What's with transparency? They're no better than the government paying for private information on people's phones. This is a problem!",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jfsmsm/serious_concern_about_zoom/,ldra994

I was really looking for something simple that would clip onto my built-in laptop webcam, so in retrospect this probably wasn’t the best purchase. Now that I have it, I’m hoping to figure out how to make use of it. 

It seems like I can somehow use my phone as the camera, and an iPad for the script. If that works, it looks like I would just need some kind of tripod for the teleprompter. And i guess I would need to log-in to zoom from my phone to transmit video and login to zoom again from a laptop to view other participants’ videos/ incoming chats? Would that make sense?

2020-10-23 09:22:11,I have some serious questions about how this company operates.,"I'll start by saying I've always liked using zoom and supporting it.  However, I'm at a loss for how their organization operates - and I figure maybe if I post something about it here an employee will see it and, at the very least, try and rationalize it for me, or better yet point it out to someone who has some authority so they can see how ridiculous it is.  


I have an extensive background in IT support at a variety of MSP's for over 10 years, supporting every kind of infrastructure and client you can think of, from megachurch's to multiple biotech firms and everything in between.  I also have extensive professional commercial A/V integration experience and certifications from all the major players, including Zoom themselves.  


Unfortunately, when the pandemic hit, my company was hit HARD.  Being as live tours made 80% of their business, they ended up letting go of over 85% of us.  No hard feelings, I get it - there were some cool projects and I'll always appreciate them.  That brings me to Zoom.    


Zoom has a job listing posted for ""Technical Support Engineer - Tier 2"" in the Bay Area.  I look at their qualifications and have more than double the amount of experience they are looking for in every aspect.  And hey, I'm even Zoom certified already and have designed and integrated every type of Zoom system you can imagine.  So I apply.    


Two days later I get a message saying my background didn't match what they were looking for.    


Well, quite frankly, that's bullshit.  Having worked in Commercial AV in the bay, as well as for digital signage startups, and the MSP's I've been at, I know that there aren't quite as many crossover IT/AV guys as you'd think.  Most people do one or the other out here.  Regardless,  I can accept that maybe somehow they found so many people matching my qualifications in this pandemic-era that they decided not to grant me an interview, however ill-advised that seems to be from the job posting's requirements.  


Now, that would normally be the end of it, but here's the thing - a week later, they are now reposting the same position again.    


I'm sorry, Zoom, but seriously?  Hey, maybe if you had a recruiting department that had even the tiniest clue what the heck they were doing you wouldn't need to repost after telling overqualified candidates that would be thrilled to work with you that their background wasn't a match.  It's one thing to have all your interview slots filled... but it's another to just ignore good candidates for no reason.

Sorry if this question has been posted before, I couldn't immediately find it. I am hosting a multi-day conference for my institution. At any given moment, we would like to have 3 simultaneous panels. 

How can I do this? I am the main event coordinator, so ideally all activity would be centered in one account. If I purchase 3 licenses to my account and assign 3 different users to function as hosts (me and 2 staff), would that work? Or will we not be able to host concurrent meetings from the single account? Any advice would be so appreciated, I'm suddenly having to learn all these news skills for a job I've had forever and want to do a good job :)    


Would it be better to have a video webinar account? It's pricier I saw, and we would like audience members to be able to pose questions via microphone, so to me meetings seems sufficient, but am open to hearing experiences.

STORY: i was in class but on facetime with a friend (camera off in class). i was trying to work on a large essay for another class and was stressed, and said to my friend out loud “god, i wanna ditch this class SO bad. but theres only 5 more minutes so i’ll stick it out.” i wasn’t looking at the zoom page, so i don’t know if my name popped up on the screen or not or if she was sharing her screen so my name wouldn’t pop up, but the teacher then said “who said that??” she seemed offended (duh), and i felt HORRIBLE, because i’d never be so rude upfront. she was recording the lecture and mentioned posting it, but i haven’t seen it, and it’s been almost 2 weeks.

i feel horrible, so here is my question: for the remainder of the class, should i put forth more effort and show i’m a good student, or hang back and keep my head down to finish this class? i’m a good student and wouldn’t just stop doing my work because of this.

TL;DR: accidentally said out loud in a zoom class that i wanted to ditch, teacher didn’t see it was me (but might look back to see later), and i’m wondering how to continue in the class (be more active or draw back).",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jhe3nd/zoom_faux_pas_what_do_i_do/,p4rtyg0th

The multi spotlight works fine for people connected on a Windows Operating System Device.  The problem only seems to be with mobile devices showing active speaker.

We want people to be able to talk but only 2 people to be on speaker view.  We do not want active speaker to be on during this type of meeting because the two on spotlight need to interact with the attendants but we don't want the attendants camera's to pop up on the screen.

Sometimes, on the breakout room, I can't share my screen. The host has already allowed participants to share their screen and everybody, except for me, can share their screen. 

All the other participants are joining through: **PC; iPad; iPhone**

When I'm in the room where the other person is a **PC user**, I can share my screen, but if there's someone with an **iPhone** on my room, the message ""host disabled participant screen sharing"" appears. Others can share their screen, the message appears only to me! 

This is my hypothesis, but I'm not sure that this is the bug. I just know that several times I'm the one that can't share the screen.

2020-10-27 17:52:29,[SUGGESTION] quick exchange with someone when in main room,"Few months I shared with Zoom this idea to imitate a possibility we have in real life, that is **to have a quick exchange with someone**, even when there are many people.

It's impossible to do that in Zoom. You'd have to go in a breakout room with that person, which is cumbersome (and you'd need their authorization).

&amp;#x200B;

My update on this idea would now to **use Push-to-Talk**:

1. We are in group, in the main hall (imagine 50 people exchanging here)
2. And you longpress on the thumbnail of a specific person (much like when you send a vocal message in whatsapp)
3. That isolate your voice: what you say will only be heard by the receiver, and not by the crowd.
   1. Of course, it would be very clear that you're speaking only to that person: I imagine a countdown timer, much like in whatsapp

&amp;#x200B;

That person has the possibility to reply, by doing the same with your thumbnail (means you're not forcing them on a 1to1 conversation, they keep hearing the others)",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jiy7vd/suggestion_quick_exchange_with_someone_when_in/,Bibelo78

2020-10-28 03:54:35,Trying to convert a round-robin live event into a virtual one. Ideas?,"Our group has an annual event every year where students sign up to meet with up to 3 mentors in various expertise areas. The mentors are in different rooms and every half hour the students switch rooms (whichever they like) to meet with another mentor.  

Zoom’s breakout rooms function would seem obvious for this, but there’s no way that I can see that students can choose the rooms themselves. We expect to have almost 200 students in this event and I can’t imagine a way for that large number of students to be assigned on the fly to different rooms they want every half hour, it would be absolute chaos. (At our normal, 
non virtual event they just go down the hall
following a map to the different rooms...)

We thought of assigning mentors to separate meetings (as opposed to breakout rooms within one meeting) and just giving out links to the students to choose which mentors they want, but we can only have 2 simultaneous meetings on our Pro account and we expect something like 50-60 mentors to be at this event, so that won’t fly either. 

We’ve considered breaking up the event to more than just one night, but that also has its challenges as we can’t really schedule the mentors on more than one night as they are super busy.

Does anyone have any ideas on how we could
make this work with Zoom?   The event is supposed to be casual networking...",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jj8i6e/trying_to_convert_a_roundrobin_live_event_into_a/,onetruename

2020-10-28 10:43:00,Probably stupid tech issue - most of my buttons are grayed out.,"Hi Zoom enthusiasts. I don't use Zoom too often (I'm WFH but we use Microsoft Teams) and I'm definitely not an expert with it. However, I tutor an ESL student and we now use Zoom to talk once a week. We've been using it fine, without any real issues, for awhile, but tonight for some reason I couldn't start a meeting - most of my buttons are grayed out. I spent about fifteen minutes trying to make it work - I logged out and logged in, I poked around in my settings trying to see if there was one set to ""set to not able to start meeting"" (not that I could see), and since ""schedule a meeting"" is the only button I can touch I scheduled a meeting for now to see if that would create a meeting window - but no such luck.

This is what my screen looks like: https://imgur.com/a/xzN43ed.

Like I said, we've been using Zoom without an issue for awhile, and I'm pretty sure I didn't randomly fuck up all of my settings before closing it out last week. But clearly something is wrong and it's probably something I did. Any ideas?

2020-10-29 00:17:54,Guest Mic Audible as They Join from Waiting Room,"So, I've had this bug happen a few times with a couple different students.  I use a waiting room for my class with the option to have users microphones muted upon entry.  When I click the button to let them in, they don't join, but their microphone audio is clearly audible and I have no way to mute it.  Typically, they ultimately fail to join, which turns their audio off again, and requires me to hit the button again, having the process start over until they do get in.

&amp;#x200B;

So, it goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Student enters waiting room

&amp;#x200B;

2) I hit the Admit button

&amp;#x200B;

3) They get a \*Joining...\* status

&amp;#x200B;

4) Their microphone sound is audible

&amp;#x200B;

5) They fail to join

&amp;#x200B;

6) Microphone sound ends

&amp;#x200B;

7) Repeat a few times until they get in

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea what is happening or how to stop it?  It's kind of weird hearing what's going on when we're not supposed to.

2020-10-29 07:09:28,Recording Meetings in different views,"Hi all-- a bit of a weird question here. I'm a theater professor working on a virtual production. I won't get into the complicated setup we'll be using for our performance, but I've got some very...particular needs I'm trying to get out of Zoom. We'll be working to prerecord some live performances then stitch together later through OBS to broadcast  (I'd be happy to DM with anyone who wants to know more).

I'm wondering if each participant in the call is able to record the meeting &amp; capture *only* the full screen video of their webcam, while still being able to view other participants in grid mode during the call. 

In Zoom terms: is there a way for to change settings to record the meeting in a view different from the one a user is in? Can I view the meeting in grid mode, and record just a pinned speaker? 

I use speaker view for class, and I know you can see a grid of other participants in a ""pop out"" window. If you record the meeting in that format, does Zoom also record that floating panel, or only the speaker window? I haven't played with the recording settings and can test this out, but figured I'd ask while I was here!

Suffering college student here - as if online classes weren’t already a drag, recently I’ve been hitting some SERIOUS lag spikes while in Zoom classes and trying to type in google docs or do other work. I don’t usually have many tabs open or other tasks running, and I’m not sure if this is an internet issue or a CPU usage issue; notably, kernel_task seems to be unreasonably high usage in the activity monitor during these spikes, which consist of freezing for around 10-15 seconds (the entire computer complete with beach ball of death), then a cut back in with horrendously demonic audio, with a de-sync between audio and video before finally fixing itself after about 30 seconds, all before repeating itself. What the f*** is going on that this could still be happening with amazing internet and decent RAM?

Apologies if this has been answered— was having trouble finding anything similar in the search function.

I'm working on a project in which I need to record all of the participants in a call with over 75 participants, but I'm reading that the max number of participants Zoom can show at once in Gallery View is 49. Would the recording only show the first page with 49 thumbnails, or would it export a separate video with the remaining participants in the call? Or would the best option be to have multiple calls going at once, and divvy up the callers so they can all fit in gallery view?

2020-10-31 03:48:56,Zoom host confusion: How many hosts do I need?,"My organization is hosting a large conference and using Zoom webinars and meetings to facilitate a lot of discussion. We've found it really difficult to determine how many of the various products we need to purchase to pull this off, and I'm hoping that one of you might be able to help out. Here's how it's working.

1. We have 3 webinars, with no more than 300 people in one.
2. We have—at the same time—6 meetings at a time.

Our plan is to have a small group of people, each of whom will begin each of these webinars and meetings, turn the host duties over to a ""moderator"", and then leave the webinar or meeting. 

We were planning to purchase the ""Business"" plan, which gives us 10 hosts. In addition, we were planning to purchase webinars with 3 hosts, with up to 500 participants.

Is this enough given the plan I outlined above? If we turn the host duties over to a moderator is that person considered an additional host on the plan? For example, if each of the 3 webinars have host duties turned over to a moderator, does that mean we need 6 webinar hosts?

Sometimes it doesn't pick it up, so he is barely audible, until he then moves his mouth closer to the microphone, and something ""clicks"" and the volume is back to normal.

I'd like to eliminate any  wasted ""is my slide deck showing?"" or ""You are now the presenter."" time, and flow from one presentation to the next.  When your first slide comes up, start talking :-) 

Some experienced presenters advised that the only way is for me, the host, to display and advance their slides.  But that results in the annoying audible ""Next Slide.""  from the presenter.

In this case the presenters are all busy with jobs and volunteering, so asking them to do a dry run is a big ask.  I'd rather do the work to ensure that things just flow on presentation day (dream on, right?) 

Is there an in-between solution?  Where the slides are loaded in sequence, but the presenter can advance them?

2020-11-02 01:56:24,Technical Problems....,"Good Afternoon,

I decided to post on here as a bit of a last resort, but I have been having some really big problems with the Zoom app on my laptop and it doesn't seem to be a generic one. I tried to ring up a person on Support but you need a business account to do so, and I do not have a host key that allows me to do this, or to send a open email request ticket. I am just totally, completely stumped by this issue at this point now.

This all started two weeks ago where the app was originally working fine and as normal. When I clicked on a link to join the same meeting the week after (on last Thursday, the 22nd of October) I got a message saying that I was already in a meeting and that I need to leave it to join this one, I knew for a fact that this was not true because the phone app would allow me to join the meeting, so I believed it to be a technical glitch or error. I googled the issue and found that I had to go on my settings and log out of all devices, but since I was ""already in a meeting"" all of the links were blanked out and inaccessible. I tried to go onto my settings but the app just wouldn't respond to me.

One week later, this issue is still persisting. So, I had a bash at uninstalling the app and reinstalling it. The Zoom installer would abrutly crash at 52%, and the Zoom Client installer that you can download when I clicked on the link would crash and stop abruptly at 10&amp;. One week later, I have deleted the app and then reinstalled it multiple times, along with deleting all of the app data on my computer, and the issue is that it appears to install the app successfully, but whenever I try to open it, I just get no response from it at all. I have now spent up to 8 hours trying to solve it this weekend, but I'm still always getting the no response treatment and I'm never given an error code or any troubleshooting info, I just get absolutely no activity from the app at all. It's really frustrating because I'm part of two large groups who all do their meetings on Zoom, but I just can't access it in any way at all. As a workaround, I tried to join using the desktop website version of Zoom, but all I can get when I try to do that is a fuzzy bunch of audio and the video breaking up. I have spent HOURS trying to sort it, but I just end up trying to install it and going around the same circle.

This is an unprecedented issue and I haven't been able to find any support online that's of use to me and I can't even talk to a real person about the issue.

Please can you help? You will be my new favourite superhero!

I’m not very familiar with it though and was wondering if there was a way I could send through multiple rooms on an email to all the invitees and they can use this to hop from room to room during the evening.

If I emailed over a few rooms with headings like “kitchen” “dining room” “garden” etc would these rooms stay open for people to come and go as they please?

I just don’t like the idea of one huge room where only one person can talk at once (or at least has the floor while they’re talking and only one conversation can happen at once) and want to give people a chance to move around and talk in smaller groups like they usually would at my party.

2020-11-02 21:20:15,Video Backgrounds on Macbook Air??,"I saw a similar post on this topic while i was trying to find answers.

I use a Macbook Air Version 10.12.6 that i got in 2017.  The problem is, and you might have already guessed, I can't use videos as background. 

I tried to shorten the video from 58 seconds to 15 seconds, then i also tested if it didn't work on other videos.

I came to the conclusion that only images can be used. 

I also noticed some other users have options of ""photo"" or ""video"" when clicking that plus sign thingie. 

I was wondering, is it simply because my laptop does not support it? 

Is there really no other way to have a video as my background?

I would like to know if there's any way i can do it, because I'm a bit desperate right now.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jmn9bs/video_backgrounds_on_macbook_air/,Moriko_Morisaki

We are the team behind r/nowpush (an app you should all also check out) we have been working on several projects after a recent hack-a-thon and we decided to ship a beta of our best hack-a-thon project, and we are calling it “Never Miss A Meeting”.

You will get 5 free meetings when you will sign up after the beta phase but we will give you 10 additional meetings if you sign up via the link before we go live!

We will have a unlimited (a paid service) meeting option and a referral program, so when we are live you can share your code and get free meetings when other use your code to sign up.

The idea behind this product is to make attending college/university/meetings a better experience in these COVID/distance/lockdown times. This is just the beginning of this product, and initially we will just attend for you, to keep your attendance record, so only use this app when you intend on missing recorded meetings (or don’t!), so you can catch up on your own time. We will record the meeting for you in a few weeks once that feature is complete.

I custom built my own PC which has a Ryzen 3 3200g, 16GB DDR4 ram, rx570 GPU, and 500GB m.2 SSD. One of my siblings mainly uses a PC with a 4th-gen i5 and some old Nvidia GPU. With the new software update 5.4.1, the i5 computer can now do virtual backgrounds. I have been using XSplit so far as my background remover, so when I heard that the i5 could remove background with the most recent update, I was excited because my Ryzen 3 is definitely more powerful than the i5.

But to my disappointment, I saw that my PC doesn't apparently have enough ""juice"" to power background removal. I find this very interesting as my PC is definitely more powerful than a 4th-gen i5. So why is it like this? Can I fix it?

My preferred resolution is SD, both for bandwidth reasons and because it is cropped more tightly around me, showing less of the room behind me.  If I switch to HD *or* ""Original Ratio,"" I get too much background.  It also means that I can't use my greenscreen because it's not big enough to cover the entire HD field of view.  

So here's the problem.  After working great for most of the semester, all of a sudden my class session is locked on HD.  Not the setting.  I can change the setting all day, but the actual view presented does not change.  It stays HD.

But it's only for the class session.  My office hours session still allows me to turn HD (and original ratio) off and on, and the change actually takes hold.  Other, ad hoc meetings still support the smaller image.

I don't want to create a new session for class meetings, because that's a bump in the road for students.  I can live with the HD image if I have to, but it would be nice to be able to change it back.

2020-11-04 07:24:46,Zoom closes my support tickets immediately - from paying Pro account!,"All of my support tickets are automatically closed.

I get it, Zoom has grown as a business MASSIVELY in the last 6 months. I'm sure they're struggling to hire and train people to help support their growth. I've been a paying Pro member since March and for much of that time, the service has worked half-way decently.

However, I have had some problems. They're not important to you, usually technical issues. I have sent perhaps 5-6 support tickets since March. The first one, from March (the day after I started my account), Zoom replied to in September. Wow, yeah, that's a long time! But at least they finally replied, I know, they're busy, there's a pandemic going on and they're, you know, busy.

Since then, *every single support ticket is immediately closed*. I've tried sending them as ""Normal"", ""Important"" and ""Urgent"" and no matter, the ticket is closed. They say that Pro accounts are still entitled to web support, which obviously isn't true. Here's their response to every one of these closed tickets:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Hi XXXXXXXX,  
&gt;  
&gt;As our world comes together to slow the spread of  COVID-19 pandemic, the Zoom Support Center has continued to operate 24x7  globally to support our customers through this unprecedented period.  Given increased usage from businesses small and large and exponentially  growing demand from the education and healthcare sectors, we have  experienced an unexpected surge in support requests.  
&gt;  
&gt;To better serve you, we are providing additional online resources along with some **temporary** changes to our support processes.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Online Resources**

&gt;**Support Changes**  
&gt;  
&gt;The following temporary changes will be in effect:  


&amp;#x200B;

* For all Free account holders, we will only be able to offer unrestricted access to our [Online Resources](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360042982391).
* **We will continue to offer web support to owners and administrators of Pro accounts. (emphasis mine)**
* We will continue to offer web, chat, and phone support to owners and administrators of Zoom Business and Enterprise accounts.
* For all accounts, other resources such as [reporting abusive behavior](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/200613919), [querying billing](mailto:billing@zoom.us) and [contacting sales](https://zoom.us/contactsales) are still available.

&gt;Unfortunately,  we are unable to respond to your open tickets at this time. We  encourage you to leverage our Online Resources. If you are a part of a  corporate account, and need advanced technical support beyond our Online  Resources, please contact your Zoom account administrators.  
&gt;  
&gt;We  understand that some of these changes are challenging, and we  appreciate your patience as we scale up our support to meet the dramatic  influx of customer demand. Together, we will help tackle one of the  largest and most disruptive crises we have faced in our lifetime.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for choosing Zoom to stay connected and safe in these uncertain times.

This is really frustrating. Go to [zoom.us](https://zoom.us) right now and you can sign up for a new (paid) account, but know that if you're a Pro user, they're not offering any support, but on paper they claim that they do offer support.

The only support I can find is through this subreddit and sometimes lots of trial and error. I'm having some challenges with their software that I'm not finding the solution to. I am signed up for one of their live trainings, which I've done before and they do offer the opportunity for questions, but there should be easier ways to get some answers from them.

My final question is, is there way to mobilize social media to get their attention? I can't be the only Pro user wanting tech support but getting my tickets immediately closed.

If I can't get this resolved by Zoom, then I will be seeking an alternative to Zoom and requesting a partial refund of the annual fee I paid.",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jnlgee/zoom_closes_my_support_tickets_immediately_from/,bombadil1564

Hello, I am trying to transmit / receive stereo audio via Zoom. The option to enable stereo is switched on on both sides, however the sound is mono. Either channel on the sending end is getting to both on the receiving. Both sides are Mac computers, with headphones. Sender has a sound card, which generates stereo (proven by other means). Tried different sender setups, including different cards. Does anyone know that the problem can be? Also, the overall sound quality (while transmitting / receiving) is not that great. Please help!!

""

And he found out ""...It turns out Zoom (and also Hangouts) gets crazy when there's more than 2 channels of audio available and instead of treating the first 2 as stereo, it takes all and puts them in the center, making effectively mono. ... ""

However whenever we start a second meeting when the first is already running, the second host gets a message that there's already a meeting running, and an option to end the first meeting (which has lead to disaster on several occasions).

So here's a tricky one: 

Im organising a ""virtual"" general-assembly via a Zoom-Webinar which includes some votings,   
i've done that a few times for other companies without any issues. The tricky part with this company is that there are different member types, some of which are allowed to vote and some are not. 

How would you handle that? I thought about streaming the zoom to vimeo and only let the allowed voters join the zoom and the others can just watch the stream in the vimeo-player, but then the not-allowed ones are not able to ask questions. 

Another option would be to do the polling over Slido or Mentimeter and share that over Zoom-Screenshare, then we would send out the voting-links only to the eligible mekmbers. 

Any other ideas? In General All participants should be allowed to ask questions but not everybody should be able to vote. Too bad that Zoom doesnt allow weighted polls, that would make everything so much easier!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jr2o9y/zoom_to_vimeo_split_up_qa_and_polling/,tobi_-

I've been teaching using zoom for a while and i never had a problem. I was doing it in my 5 years old Asus xp540l with corei3 and 4 GB of ram. 
I bought a new laptop, and Acer Aspire 5 with ryzen 5 and 12 GB of ram. It was a little hot but nothing so serious.
The day of My class when I started screen sharing and making some notes in paint after 10 minutes the screen froze. I reset the laptop and tried to continue but it happened again so I decided to stop the class and return the device.
The store told me it was a problem with the motherboard so I got my money back and started looking for another device. I bougth one but had to wait 2 weeks until it arrives. I was using my old laptop for my class and it went perfeclty. I just receive My new laptop, a Lenovo Ideapad 5 with ryzen 7 and 16 GB of ram.
It all was okay but it happened again the day of My class. The device freezes when screen sharing. I think this is not a problem of the device.
I don't think I receive two devices in Bad state. They are from different stores. I don't want to return the last device and wait more time.
So I don't know what is wrong with My new device or the one I returned.  I'm concerned why My old laptop runs screen sharing perfeclty while the new ones freeze.
Another thing is that they both reached 80 °c when screen sharing and they both felt really hot.

So if anyone knows something I would be very please. Sorry for My gramatical mistakes, I'm not a native speaker.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jr317n/problems_with_screen_sharing/,frnc0rlz

**What is a hybrid event?** 

A hybrid event is a combination of a live in person experience with a virtual online element. 2020 has seen a boom of virtual events and they won’t be going away anytime soon. We’re also seeing creative ways of gathering in person, with outdoor dining, ticketed time slot experiences, drive-ins and new solutions created by clever event organizers paying attention to health and safety protocols. With Zoom fatigue and an eagerness to connect with others, we’re beginning to see more hybrid events, and predict there will be a rise of even more going into 2021.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jr32ok/benefits_of_hybrid_events/,events27

2020-11-10 09:10:04,"Virtual Background sees me, but not the object I'm holding","Hello all, 

I have a class group project that needs to be completed via zoom. We are using little paper cut outs of people on sticks like a puppet to talk about our presentation. We all have virtual backgrounds of photos of the places we're talking about. We all have the same problem of the cameras picking us up in front of the background but not picking up the puppets we are holding. If my puppet is in front of me, it shows up on the screen. As I move it to the left or right on the screen, it disappears behind the background and stays out of view. Does anyone have a suggestion for how I can make it show up in front of the virtual background?

Maybe I'm not seeing it on the official site, but maybe someone can help me out. I'd need to organise a conference, so it's going to be used for one week max. 

* Participans - about 150? Let's say 200. 
* Rooms - I think 8 rooms. 
* Presentations - of course it's a must.

So first question, at which plan I should look? Just zoom meetings? Or zoom video webinars?

And the last, the most important, I looked zoom up, and I see that it's billed annually or monthly. But is there an option that I could resigne from subscription after one month?  Or just buy license for only one month?

2020-11-10 23:11:35,Zoom Desktop Client NOT WORKING (URGENT)(PLEASE HELP),"Hello, 

I installed zoom yesterday on my Windows laptop, and have been having multitude of issues. I would appreciate it if anyone could help, I will describe everything in detail below. Basically, I have downloaded Zoom. Every time I launch the app from the start, or from the taskbar, or even from file explorer, it takes about 15 minutes to launch. After it launches, it will take another 15-20 minutes to either launch the meeting when I hit new meeting, or when I click on the join button, the pop up takes forever to launch. When I use a link to join from a browser, it takes forever to launch, same thing as what I have described above. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Zoom, restarted, even reset my laptop, and wiped the whole thing, and set it up fresh, still doesn't work. I highly doubt it has something to do with my CPU speed or internet connection, I am getting 100 mbps internet, and have an intel core i5 with 8gb ram and 256 GB SSD. I would really really appreciate the help as I need this for school. If anyone has anything that would help, please reply in the comments, it is much much appreciated. Thank you in advance. I am looking forward to getting this fixed as soon as possible.

2020-11-12 04:25:19,GoPro Hero 8 Black as Mobile Zoom Camera,"I'm sure I can't be the first person with this problem, but I sure can't find anyone else or a good solution. I work as an electrical field tech at a university and have student assistants who went from being alongside me to working from home.

To keep things interesting and demonstrate as much as I can remotely, I grabbed an unused iPhone 5c, installed Zoom, and mounted the phone to my hardhat. 

Before leaving the shop, I join a Zoom meeting that our students are in. They love it since it gives a live, FPV shot of me working in electrical closets and such. I can also hear them and talk to them live to explain what needs to be done, or ask how they think I should fix something.

We have great WiFi across campus so that isn't an issue. What is, is that the iPhone 5c's camera sucks. Even in good lighting, it's difficult for my student assistants to see labels on equipment or electrical connections. 

Our department recently got a GoPro Hero 8 Black. The Marketing folks gave it to me to mount it to my hardhat and record B-roll of our field calls. That got me thinking, there has to be a way to use the GoPro as a better camera.

I briefly looked at the GoPro app, but I didn't see a way to tie the GoPro to Zoom for iOS. I saw that there is a way to do so in MacOS, and I do have access to a MacBook, but dragging a $2,000 laptop into electrical closets along with being tethered to it via a USB cable isn't a good solution.

Is it possible to use a GoPro with the Zoom mobile app? I figured I could mount the GoPro to my hardhat and keep the iPhone 5c in my pocket or on a belt clip.

I was in a zoom call that ended at 6:45 pm, and then at 8 pm when I tried to log in to a webinar, the app sat on 'connecting' for ages before timing out with error 104101. I didn't do anything to my computer in between - I'd gone to eat dinner. 

I signed in to the webinar with my phone via wifi (turned the data off to be sure that I was using wifi), and was able to stream the webinar, so the issue is neither my wifi or my account. I was also able to connect through the browser version of zoom. The app was unable to connect to a test call - same error as before

I've uninstalled and reinstalled Zoom twice, ran a Windows update that was sitting there (Windows 10), and checked my firewall settings - everything seems clear, and the app still will not connect. I have to present tomorrow and would like my app back! Zoom won't help, because I'm a free user. How do I fix this?",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jt7qz1/zoom_app_connection_issues/,Complete_Elk

2020-11-13 13:44:41,Zoom Crashing Wifi Randomly Potential Solution,"Hi everyone, 

This is a long post, so if you don't want to read the background info, then please skip to the end for the solution. Also, please note that while this solution did work for me, it might not necessarily work for you. Please do let me know if this works, so I may share with others.

After struggling to learn from online classes at Zoom University for \~7 months because of frequent and random Zoom crashes, I think I may have found a solution to the crashing problem and have decided to post here since I have seen some posts about the issue.

**A little bit of background:** I have a Dell XPS 13 9365 with the Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 8265 Network adapter. I have relatively good internet speeds: 117 mbps download and 11 upload. 

**Experimentation:** At first, I thought the crashing was either the Zoom app or my wifi router/modem, but either way it was frustrating. To test this, I had my iPhone and computer on the same Zoom meeting for several weeks and found that Zoom never crashed on my iPhone while it did indeed crash on my computer. That implied that the issue was not my wifi and most likely not the Zoom app on my computer. That left one possibility left, which was my computer's wifi card/adapter. One very notable thing that occurred when Zoom crashed was that the computer indicated that my wifi connection dropped. To confirm that the router wasn't the issue once more, I checked my iPhone and the internet was still working. I updated my wifi driver as a next step, but no luck. In short, I tried everything people suggested on the web and anything I could think of without success.

**SOLUTION:** This is what you guys/gals came for. In the end, I started messing with the network adapter's settings in device manager as a desperate and final attempt at solving the problem. I suspected the problem had to do with the wifi card going to sleep or something along those lines so I tried looking for a setting like that, and that's where the solution lied. I found this solution about two weeks ago and Zoom has not crashed since so...good luck!

1) Type in ""Device Manager"" into the windows search bar.

2) Go to ""Properties""

3) Go to the Driver tab and select ""MIMO Power Saver Mode"" and select ""No SMPS."" Basically, it never lets your wifi antenna go to sleep at the expense of battery life. More details below.

2020-11-14 12:41:15,Sunday - Virtual Convention Convention,"Hello,  
while I have a 6 year old reddit account ([https://imgur.com/a/CrT7Q0O](https://imgur.com/a/CrT7Q0O)), I'm using this one to avoid doxing.

I'm putting together a website/community and event for people who are running small virtual conventions. The initial live event is on November 15, 2020 (Sunday) starting at 12:30 EST  
**Virtual Convention Convention** \- for those who run virtual conventions and conferences  
[https://virtualconcon.cyou/](https://virtualconcon.cyou/)

So far three new tool vendors will give talks/demos, and a couple of people who have run cons will give a talk. There's one pre-recorded talk posted, discussing how their con went from 400 in person last year, to 10K virtual this year, and had Elon Musk among the 128 speakers.

The goal is to make the website a free hub for information on putting on a virtual convention or conference (or seminar, or poster session, or tradeshow, or arts show….. basically the next step beyond a meeting). Not just for a single meeting, the site will remain active, hopefully for years, and will host informal bi-weekly meetings.

I had a lot of fun participating in a virtual convention. I also enjoyed a few other virtual conventions, and was disappointed in how one enormous, in person convention, was translated to virtual.  

Seems like lots of organizers of small, low budget events are trying to solve similar problems.  

I thought that bringing them together for a day, so that virtual in person conversations can happen, would be good. Scheduling short informal talks and panel discussions could clue people into what they didn't know they didn't know. 

Zoom link will be displayed when you register on the site.

I would appreciate it if you could pass it onto anyone you know who may be interested. Social share buttons are on the bottom of the pages.

We're using a combination of pre-recorded and live speakers and music in our church services, and I'm the guy who usually shares a window to play the pre-recorded clips, from my Mac.

Quicktime is unreliable.  It will play fine one time, then start getting chopping video and sometimes stop playing in any useful way at all.

I've been using VLC, but it's kind of awkward.  I like to get the videos all lined up and ready in my playlist, but I want to switch to each and get them ready before playtime, but VLC always wants to start playing them immediately, so I have to start the video to get the window up, then pause the video and wind back a couple seconds to the beginning.  Plus the 2nd window with the playlist and controls disappears when the video is opened, so everyone sees the on-screen controls and my mouse clicks to start it.  Not a big deal, but could be more professional.

Anything better out there?  Would like to have controls in a different window, and be able to queue up a video that's paused on the opening frame and will start as soon as I click a play button, then pause on the last frame.

I first thought that it was my iPad (9.7 inch Pro model) or my Pencil that were the issue, but I have changed the tip of the pencil and it's still the same. And since every other app seems to be working fine with the pencil, it tells me that this is an issue with the whiteboard in Zoom.

In test, I added another account as an admin, but when testing that user, it still told me, when scheduling a meeting under that added admin account, that it was going to be limited to 40 min?

2020-11-16 23:54:49,PSA: Bitdefender might cause slow connection to Zoom,"Over the last weeks I have been struggeling with Zoom taking a long time to connect to meetings, and the time it takes to join/exit breakout rooms. Lately it has been as bad as 18-20 seconds, and when I finally got in, everyone was shown as grey boxes with sound coming through choppy for the first 5-10 seconds before pictures and sound sync up and everything is fine.

This even applied to creating my own meetings - pressing ""New meeting"" would result in nothing happening for 18-20 seconds.

Now, I have several devices on my network, and this was happening to my desktop, which is wired directly into the router. The issue didn't happen to any other device - all meetings start within 5 seconds on every other device on the same network.

After Googling and troubleshooting every setting i could find both in the router and Win10, i decided to uninstall Bitdefender Antivirus Free (which I only used on my desktop, never bothered to install it on my laptop). I rebooted and VOILA - Zoom connects in 4 seconds now, no problems at all.

I decided to put this as a PSA here as the only similar information I could find on the web for this exact issue was [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zoom/comments/ii8vhy/zoom_lagging_on_desktop_but_not_mobile_devices/).

I was wondering earlier how to disable the zoom feedback notif at the end of a meeting and figured it out. Incase anyone ever has a similar problem thought I'd share the answer here. I know nobody really cares about it but here it is anyways.

1. Look up ""zoom sign in"" or something to that effect

2. Sign in on zooms website (The first result)

3. Where it says meetings or something with an arrow click that and change to ‘settings’

4. Scroll down to where it says ""In Meeting (Basic)"" you can use ctr f to get there faster and just type 'Feedback to Zoom'

5. Locate 'Feedback to Zoom' and slide the bar to enable and disable the feedback option

I recently started a live streaming company (www.collectivebroadcast.co) and we have been *very* busy lately and using Zoom as the interface for a tonne of our live Q+As / performances / meetings / artist talks / etc.  

While we really glad it exists and prefer it greatly over the crap alternatives our there (ie. Skype, Teams, etc) I really wish they would come out with some more helpful controls for broadcasters + live streamers like us.

In my mind it's call ZOOM STUDIO and it provides the host with volume controls for each participant, ability to access each feed separately as a video input, control of each participant's settings even, etc.

I should add that we are using OBS as the main streaming software but Zoom as an interface for most of our live talks / conversations / q+as / etc.

2020-11-17 12:56:39,"Can Zoom PLEASE make some cool, creative filters/lenses?? (School district doesn't allow Snap Camera)","I teach general music  PK through 8th grade, and our district has been virtual since the start of the school year. It's tough to be a kid during a pandemic...and how do you do school? One thing I know is that once students reach 5th grade, they DO NOT like to be seen on camera. I respect those feelings (I remember middle school).  

We've taught students how to use virtual backgrounds...but the kids really aren't very uncomfortable with other people seeing the room they're in.  Lots of my students are perfectly comfortable showing their wall or ceiling. The just aren't comfortable showing their faces. 

Every now and then, a student is logged onto zoom from a non-school device, and if they can apply a snap camera lens--they keep their camera on and participate! Rainbow hair, Day of the Dead face, Bubble Eyes, Anime.... Believe it or not, it's not distracting, it's community-building. Those are the days with the most class discussion. When kids enjoy being here...they also enjoy learning. And they are much more motivated to tackle something difficult. 

So my message for Zoom is...WE NEED THIS! I'm serious...filters/lenses that are fun and interesting...would be a game-changer. 

The filters on Zoom aren't enough. Sunglasses, a hat, a flower in my hair, bunny nose and ears...it's just not interesting enough.

Are either of those two things coincidental or are others experiencing the same?

When I say Zoom crashed, I mean that it completely freezes the screen. The PC is still responsive to the mouse &amp; keyboard (I know this because of things like activating sticky keys you get an auidble alert) but you can't see anything that you're doing because the screen is frozen.

2020-11-18 04:01:42,"If you pin someone in a zoom meeting, will it privately message them?","I am currently enrolled in an online yoga class at my college. Our teacher told us at the end of class to send our names into the chat so she can get attendance. The only guy in the class privately messaged me his name. I was confused at first because I'm not sure how private messages really work, but we don't use the chat often in this class so it was even more weird. One of my friends told me that maybe he pinned my screen instead of our teachers and just watched me do yoga the whole time and that's why it only sent to me and not the entire class like normal. I don't know much about zoom or how it works, so if someone can explain if this is really what's happening, that would be appreciated.

I want to bring it up to my teacher because this student is the only male in the class, he lives in France (we're a CA based college), he never participates in the yoga , just sits there and stares, and it's a 1.5 unit class so honestly not worth it. The private message was my first red flag that made me start thinking.

I am running zoom events (conversation/lecture style) for the organization I work for, and today I encountered an issue I had not run into before. Halfway through the event, it became clear that the panelists were typing messages to the private chat between myself (host) and all other panelists, but their messages were not sending. From my research, I've gathered that there is no setting that allows the host to turn off chat privileges for panelists in the webinar format. Has anyone else run into this or have any idea what could have caused it? 

A few details that might be helpful: 

* Chat for attendees was turned off
* The webinar is a recurring webinar, and this was the second one. Last week, the same panelists were able to use the chat without issue
* I sometimes turn people's audio/video on an off during these events

I realize some people sign in with different emails and log-ins and that's expected (we ghet them where they need to go manually), but we're finding only about a 30% success rate even when people DO use the right email.

2020-11-20 22:45:51,"Every time someone starts sharing their screen, the zoom window pops up.","My nephew is doing online schooling like the millions of other children. The teachers give them an assignment to read or do in the web browser after logging into a page. So he minimizes the zoom window to start doing his lesson. While he does this, the teacher is on zoom still asking if any children are having a hard time logging in and if they are asking them to share their screen. 

The annoying thing from this is that the zoom window pops up covering up the story he is reading in the browser anytime someone shares their screen and when they stop sharing their screen. With him only having this small chromebook screen to work off of, it's rather annoying have to work around the constant popup while other students are getting help to login. 

Thought I'd come here and see if there was potentially a setting I'm missing that could disable this. 

Side note: when he minimizes his zoom window, it doesn't do the picture in picture thing in the corner like it does on my work zoom account. Maybe this is a setting as well?

2020-11-23 07:48:16,"Pinning a window without all the text, menus, etc.","I'm on Mac OS X 10.15.7; Zoom 5.1.4.

I'm doing interviews with caregivers for patients with chronic kidney disease; because of covid19, I can no longer go to the clinic, and I cannot interview the caregivers in person. We're doing it over Zoom, and I'm having a couple of problems.

I have the paid version of Zoom so that I can record to the cloud. I get the gallery view and the active speaker view. I turn off my video and mic, I have one person who conducts the interview in the same place I'm in but in another room, and the caregivers are in another town. I am recording the interview for later broadcast on our local public access station, then publication on YouTube. In addition to recording to the cloud, I'm doing a screen recording with an OS application called Capto.

My problem is that in the active speaker view, when the interviewer speaks, the window stays locked on that person. When the caregiver speaks, the window goes to that person for 5 or 6 seconds, then back to the interviewer for 5 or 6 seconds, then back to the caregiver, and this goes on for the length of time the caregiver speaks. The active window locks on the interviewer while she speaks, but it never locks on the caregiver. This is unacceptable because the caregivers are more important, and whoever is watching the video should be seeing and hearing them.

Is there something I'm missing in getting the Zoom active view to show the active speaker?

I know I can pin the window the caregiver is in. However, this causes the pop up menus to pop up on the screen capture. You then see me scrolling down the ellipses (the ...), selecting pin, then letting it go, which is a distraction I'd rather avoid. I also have to unpin the caregiver, another on-screen distraction, when the interviewer talks. I don't see on Zoom's Web site a way to pin a window from the keyboard.

I understand from Zoom's Web site that I can't pin a window when recording to the cloud and that the pinning is effective only on my view of the conference, which is the view I'm recording on my computer via Capto.

Question 1: What am I doing wrong that keeps the active speaker from getting all the screen time instead of having it bounce back and forth ever few second?

Question 2: Can I pin a screen without having to go to the popup menu?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/jz6eei/pinning_a_window_without_all_the_text_menus_etc/,civex

I stream the calls I host, and this would allow me to stream the view of the participants, and manage them without my cursor showing up on stream when I want to pin someone's video or switch between speaker and gallery view.

We are having problems when using Zoom for a hybrid local/virtual meeting.

We have a large meeting room with multiple participants, and lots of remote participants, with interpretation via Zoom.

In our meeting room, we have three laptops running zoom.  Laptops 2 and 3 are connected to a transmitter and transmit the interpretation channels for participants in the room.

The problem is this.  When a person in the room is speaking, they also hear their own voice back through the interpretation channel.  They find this very distracting and annoying, and don't want to have to keep taking their headsets on and off.

I'm struggling to see how we can stop this happening, does anyone have any ideas?  The best i can think of, is that in the meeting room there is a person listening to the interpretation channel.  They have a volume mixer before the interpretation goes to the transmitter for the headsets, and when they hear a person in the room speaking, they dip the audio.  But this is a very amateurish and inelegant solution.  There must be a better way?",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/k05zka/interpretation_in_a_hybrid_localonline_meeting/,planetary_funk_alert

My professor is forcing everyone to turn on their cameras. (although 50% only turn on the camera)

I don't have a problem with it but sometimes I prefer not to, or I prefer to skip the class (so I join without camera and audio).

so from what I have read and understood , the professor can see the logs after the session and see who joined and when.

Can he see in the logs - who turned the camera on ?

which Information is revealed to him there?

2020-11-26 01:06:47,Strange problem with Zoom audio,"Okay, this one is driving me crazy. I use Zoom on my Windows 10 laptop and, frequently, there will be problems on the call where the audio seems to crackle and distort for a few seconds whenever someone new starts talking and occasionally again if they've been talking for a while. I often record the calls for a podcast and, when I play back the recordings, the distortion is audible when I speak rather than when they speak (so the problem is obviously at my end somewhere). Even more bizarrely, this tends to clear up almost completely if I'm on a call for a long time (45 mins - 1hr or so).

It's not an internet speed issue as my partner's (older and lower spec) laptop doesn't experience the problem at all and SpeedTest consistently puts us at around 105mbps. I've tried doing driver updates, uninstalling and reinstalling Zoom countless times and even doing a complete factory reset on the laptop. Same problem happens if I plug the laptop into the router via ethernet.

My laptop predominantly works fine with internet stuff other than this.

I have the following problem.

I have 4 participants on Zoom, in different locations.

Audio from participants is coming to the host laptop. From there it goes (headphone output plug) to the mixer and is delivered on stage.

The video is delivered from the second laptop, which is dedicated for the spotlight through the HDMI output.

The sound from the scene goes to Mini Atem (audio video mixer) by  XLR Female to 3.5 mm TRS cables . The video from the scene also goes to Mini Atem by hdmi .

They are embedded and synchronized and go to the participants on zoom.

So far so good.

But when the zoom feed (which came to me from the participants) is send  in streaming (from another device) together with the PGM from the scene, PGM video and audio is perfect,

  Video from Zoom is perfect but ***ZOOM AUDIO is much slower and noisier. Why***?

I was wondering what's the issue with Zoom/Skype audio quality. The compression is so bad for 2020. Many of us have a broadband internet connection of 100Mb+ yet the way these apps process voice makes it sound like it's 2010 phone call again.

I hate this ""telephone filter"". When you have a really qood mic (like Rode VideoMic Pro+) you can't really use it's full potential on neither Skype nor Zoom. Why is that? They make the voice as if I am speaking through mobile network. They support HD cameras image, but can't send the voice uncompressed? HD camera image requires \~5-6Mbps and the uncompressed voice I'd say no more than 1Mbps extra...

Am I doing anything wrong or it is the way it is? When I record voice sample in Audacity, it is perfect, no matter if I record my own voice or record music through my mic. Then I make a Zoom/Skype test call or call myself and the voice quality is - I would not say low - but still compressed.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/Zoom/comments/k1656m/skypezoom_compression_bad_for_2020/,Radek41

2020-11-27 11:29:45,Help: Jackbox Audio issues with Zoom Call and HDMI Cable to TV,"My family has been trying to play Jackbox remotely. A small group of us are in one house together, so connect my MacBook Pro (running MacOS Mojave 10.14.6) to our TV via HDMI so that everyone here can see the screen clearly. I then conduct a Zoom call with the other family members in other households, and I share my screen. However, whenever I do this, I can only get either the Jackbox audio or the Zoom audio to play through the TV speakers, but not both. The other audio will then inevitably play through my computer.

For some games (Role Models), it's fine, I just run the Zoom audio through the TV so everyone can hear everyone talking and laughing, and the Jackbox audio plays from my computer at a low volume, and I turned closed captions on. But for Mad Verse City, where the audio is a big part of the humor factor, it was a nightmare. I switched to making the Jackbox audio come loudly out of the TV so everyone in my household (including one hearing impaired person) could hear, but then the people via Zoom couldn't seem to hear the robot voices (I tried checking the ""share my computer audio"" button when sharing my screen, and I tried getting my computer mic to pick up the TV Jackbox audio, but neither was working, for whatever reason.)

Also, I have had previous Zoom calls where I click the ""share my computer audio"" and then I suddenly could no longer hear the Jackbox audio, though apparently the other Zoom members were able to hear it.

TLDR: Is there any way to get both audio outputs (Jackbox and Zoom) to go from my computer to the TV speakers via the HDMI cable? Also do you have any troubleshooting tips for making sure both the host and other people via Zoom can hear the Jackbox audio (but not so loudly that they can't hear each other talk).",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/k1ti3h/help_jackbox_audio_issues_with_zoom_call_and_hdmi/,happyhurry

2020-11-30 06:14:39,display name seems to changing automatically on Online Exams via Zoom,"Hello,

I have a special question!

**Online Exams via Zoom**

I did a test at university, and they sent us a link to zoom.

The participants placed there mobile phones, with a camera so that one can see them and the screen (from a distance). The students were supervised by a staff member using Zoom.

in the middle of the test, the staff member accidentally took the students out of the zoom. The students went back to zooming in through the link.

 5 out of 15 students who returned - their displayed names in Zoom have changed to other names !! Each of the students claims that he did not change the name. The new names are similar to the previous names - but with spelling errors.

What is the explanation for this strange phenomenon?

In this cartoon, an old couple, presumably grandparents, sit at their computer and interact with nine boxes. There is an assortment of ages in the boxes. **This cartoon was the New Yorker Daily cartoon on April 8th, 2020.** Without that crucial date, it may be confusing to grasp the hidden meaning of this cartoon. 

The coronavirus pandemic sets the scene. Because it is especially dangerous to older people, kids and their parents are advised to keep distance from their grandparents. Here, 9 boxes represent Zoom. The grandparents have food, wine, and books on their laps. They are smiling and enjoying themselves, relishing the opportunity to see their families even in an uncertain time and in 2D. They are reading storybooks that presumably match that of the little girl in the bottom right corner. She is pointing something out with an animated expression as her grandparents watch with smiles.  

**Even throughout a global pandemic, families will still find a way to connect with one another.** With wonderful programs like Zoom, we are able to stay connected and present with the people we care about. While these grandparents are likely sad they are not able to see their offspring in person, they are still able to interact with their children and read stories to their grandchildren over the internet. ***This time will pass and while it is inconvenient now, human innovation has made living through a pandemic manageable.***  

**What other programs have you personally used to maintain connection with your family, coworkers, friends, or even teammates?**

**Do you think you will continue to use Zoom to connect with relatives in far off locations even after the coronavirus pandemic dies down with the onset of a vaccine?** 

**Did you use Zoom or another video conferencing app with your family or friends prior to the pandemic?**",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/k486gp/human_adaptability/,kkatemmiller

2020-12-01 18:26:21,Autocapitalisation of random words in Zoom,"Hello first time on Reddit.  Here's the dirty of it:

My colleagues and I have random words (the same for all of us) that are auto capitalized by Zoom.

Our organisation has 3 officials languages and so far we have noticed it occuring in both Spanish and English.  

Here are the words that we found so far:

Wonder, Reason, Something, Believe, Added, Don't, Following, Clarity, También, Podemos.

We also have random French accents added to some words that are the same in both English and French like procédures (but not procedure)

Also to note, most, if not all, colleagues affected have computers that are configured in French. Those colleagues with English configured computers do not have this problem.

Lastly, this issue is unique to Zoom.  If I switch to Word, MS Teams, Skype, any other application, the behaviour of the system is perfectly normal.  No autocapitalisation occurs.

Our IT department contacted Zoom support desk  [support@zoomus.zendesk.com](mailto:support@zoomus.zendesk.com) .  Got the most condescending technician to take our case.  Despite us sending a video that perfectly outlined the issue, he provided instructions as to how to remove Autocapitilisation from the first word in the sentence.  Then he claimed it was a problem with our computers and surely was not unique to Zoom, then when I stated the contrary, he got defensive simply saying the issue certainly was not coming from their side and if all else fails, update Zoom, goodbye.

Well the problem persists and I thought I would appeal to you lovely folks for help.  Thanks, merci, gracias.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/k4ielx/autocapitalisation_of_random_words_in_zoom/,Ok_Elephant_9471

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know she had left her breakout room and was waiting there.  I didn't get any chat from her and since she had been assigned to a room I didn't get the notice that there was an unassigned participant.

&amp;#x200B;

So, help me figure this out for the future!

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Can co-hosts move from room to room if they were assigned to one by the host?
2. Am I better off just setting it so that participants can choose their room and make sure each room is clearly titled, then have everyone move through?

Our customer would like to disable all file transfers for their users (let's call them ""managed users""). In meetings where a managed user is the meeting host, this is no problem, as there is a setting that an administrator can enable for all users. However, when a managed user joins a foreign meeting, one that is not hosted by a user of the customer's company, the file transfer is enabled and could pose a security risk.

2020-12-03 21:43:25,Personal Meeting Link Broken?,"Yesterday I was having extreme issues with Zoom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been using the same zoom link all year for my personal meeting, just because it is easier than scheduling meetings for each of my 60 some odd classes. 

But yesterday it started sending about half of my students into a different zoom meeting where there was no waiting room and I could not access them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was getting calls from parents, my principal, and other teachers about why I wasn't in class. But I was and they were being sent somewhere else. 

I even had one kid go from the mystery room to my room and he said he clicked the exact same link both times. So I don't know how to fix this.

2020-12-04 13:36:55,They hear their own voice while in a meeting,"Hi! 

2 of my contacts have a similar issue. I brushed off the first one, because he didn't seem to be bothered by this, but the second one is more critical and need troubleshooting. I found a ""solution"" to the issue, but since I am not even sure what happened, I am trying to see if anyone else had the issue and can help me understand what happened exactly (or just... validate the issue/solution and share the same WTF with me...), to get rid of this issue once and for all. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Issue happened twice on Mac OS Catalina. 

\-In both case, the ""high quality audio"" parameters were all on. 

\-My second contact is using built in input and output. Sometimes they plug their headphones, which is dealt with by their Mac and automatically switch their Mac output (not changing anything in Zoom). In Zoom, microphone and speakers are set up as ""same as system"" (both of them). 

\-They hear their own voice with a small delay when their set up is on ""same as system"".

\-""Same as system"" mean, in their system; Built in microphone for the input, and Built in output for the output (switching to the headphones when they connect it). 

\-The issue was resolved when we switch microphone from ""same as system"" to ""built in microphone"" and speakers from ""same as system"" to ""built in output"". Suddenly they stopped hearing themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

To my first contact, I discovered the bug when, speaking with them, I talked about how I was using Blackhole to route my DAW to do sound demos, and that I needed a second sound software to catch back what was sent in zoom through blackhole... they were just surprised that I wasn't ""already"" hearing my own input in Zoom... and I brushed it off because ""not my problem"", so I am not sure if they use ""same as system"" too, or if it persisted. Will check in the next few days, but for now the issue is critical with the second contact - it can't happened again, and not be resolve by my blind present attempt of a solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

What could have happened there? is there any other people experiencing this quirk? is it a bug or a feature? How can I make sure the bug won't come back?

I'm new here so quick overview - our organization has a paid account and host several different Zoom events through our account. As of last Sunday (11/29/20), there were widespread reports of sound issues with iPad users specifically - participants said that, when co-hosts would share a screen, they were unable to hear any of the shared audio. They could, however, hear the co-hosts and other participants talk. This is not a problem for Mac and PC users, who reported they were able to hear everything perfectly.

Does anyone have any idea why this is? I will be putting a support ticket in with Zoom, but wanted to also check here as well.

2020-12-07 06:21:22,Zoom crashes and Not responding when turning video on,"Hi Everyone,

I've been having a major problem with zoom on my windows PC. I am able to join meetings fine with my camera turned off and just using audio and microphone. However, as soon as I turn my video on, zoom freezes and then goes not responding.

 I have tried out many things such as reinstalling the latest zoom version, changing the usb port of my webcam, reinstalling webcam and graphics card drivers, but nothing at all has helped.

This problem is extremely frustrating because everytime I need to use my video, I have to open zoom on my phone and then join the meeting from there. 

If anyone has experienced this problem or knows any possible solutions please help me out. I have final exams coming up next week and we are being proctored over zoom, so I really need this camera issue to be figured out.

But if I'm in a meeting, in Task Manager you can see Zoom is still using a lot of CPU, and while claiming it's also using the GPU, in the GPU view you can see it's not being used for any video processing or decoding. Our parent company said Zoom support recommends disabling Hardware Acceleration as it is taxing on the CPU, which makes no sense because the entire purpose of HA is to reduce CPU load, however I've managed to confirm this with Zoom support. We're using the latest HP packaged Intel drivers (Intel doesn't let you install their drivers on HP devices, only HP's version). We've checked multiple users/computers.

2020-12-09 03:08:21,Zoom Update to Breakout Rooms - Its not great.,"Zoom Breakout Room Changes:
Co-host has the same breakout room abilities as host.
 
Notes:
Host and cohost needs to be on the most recent version 
    
If host is not on the most recent version, co-host will not be able to make changes
    
You can change the host mid meeting to someone who has the most recent version to allow cohost to make changes.	 
   
* Mike (V5.4.4) (Host), Sara (5.4.6) (cohost). Jon (5.4.6) Cohost == no breakout control for cohost
* Mike (v5.4.4) gives host to Sara (5.4.6), Jon and Sara should now have the ability to modify breakout rooms. 


It does not matter who the original host or the original meeting creator is. If a person with the newer client is given host, cohost with the newer client will also have the ability to modify breakout rooms.    
//       

Very Important: Modifying breakouts rooms when breakouts are closed do not sync accross hosts/cohosts... The other Cohost/host will have their list synced with who ever opened the rooms. Once rooms are opened, any change made to one list will update immediately to all.        

* If John puts a Sean in breakout Room1 and Jessica puts the Sean in Room2, who ever opens the breakout room will have their list followed. 

* Once John opens the room, Jessica list will be over written and updated to follow Johns. While rooms are open, if Jessica moves Sean to room3, it will show that same change on Johns list.
   
//   		 
	
CSVs look a tad glitchy right now. They will upload and breakrooms will follow it, but cohost may see unexpected results.  
//     
	 
Hosts have the ability to move a participant from a breakout room to the main session. The participant will have the option to say ""Later"" if they are on the most recent client. If on a lower version, it will force them to the main room.",1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,/r/Zoom/comments/k9amiz/zoom_update_to_breakout_rooms_its_not_great/,AlphaTheAssassin

2020-12-09 06:22:17,Zoom video resolution issues?,"Hi,

I've set up my Panasonic Lumix GH4 DSLR camera to use as my camera on Zoom (using an Elgato HD60s capture card), but the quality of the camera is lower than my phone or webcam on other people's screens. 

On my screen, the picture quality and resolution are fantastic. I'm in focus and crystal clear. But when someone else joins the meeting, the picture quality they get from my camera is worse that the picture quality on my front-facing phone camera.

I've tried adjusting the lighting, the camera settings, the Zoom settings, the Elgato settings...and so far, nothing's worked.  

It seems like Zoom is throttling the quality of the video when it gets sent to other users. Is this possible? Our internet is extremely fast...500 down, and 20+ up.

Here's a pic of the quality difference.

2020-12-09 10:57:50,Real green screen background replacement: Zoom vs. Personify ChromaCam vs. Logitech Capture vs. Cisco Webex vs. XSplit VCam,"I recently picked up an Arozzi Green Screen and tested background replacement using it with Zoom, Personify ChromaCam, Logitech Capture, Cisco Webex, and XSplit Vcam. My webcam is a Logitech BRIO.

Zoom seems to be the only app of the group capable of proper edge detection with the green screen setting enabled. There are no weird light green microborders or edge flickering using it, and video was smooth.

ChromeCam and Vcam seem to lack any direct green screen support, opting to simply brute force the problem instead. The result is that they struggle with green trails, disappearing body parts, etc. Super disappointing, especially since I paid for ChromaCam. I won't be paying for Vcam, which costs even more for the same garbage.

Logitech Capture's live chroma key gives better results than both ChromaCam and Vcam but is nowhere near as good as Zoom. You can still see flickering at edges and green microborders. Also, for some reason Capture lacks actual background replacement, requiring a source such as Vcam and ChromaCam - which suck at the task. 

Cisco WebEx was a complete disaster, declaring my PC too slow for background replacement, even though Zoom pulled it off just fine.",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/Zoom/comments/k9jfs6/real_green_screen_background_replacement_zoom_vs/,jdrch

2020-12-10 01:11:07,Desktop audio-sharing significantly worse quality than mic,"I'm scratching my head here. My aim is to run some kid's programming that needs background music and/or ambience.

The audio from my mic into Zoom functions as expected; a relatively clear sound with the usual noise suppression, gating, digital compression, etc. When I try to share my computer audio, the audio that goes through that is atrocious: crushed to noise, distorting, barely audible.

I've tried sharing audio from a few different applications, and also changing my system's sample rate (I've tried 48k, 44.1k, and 32k now). 

It's possible on my setup to route my computer audio through the mic input instead. This gives me much better quality, but this will butt heads with my voice. Zoom's touch-ups interfere too much and on the Linux version there's no ""Original Sound"" setting yet.

Any ideas on what I can try? My working thesis is that the audio I'm sending Zoom isn't formatted nicely for it, but no changes have had any effect.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/Zoom/comments/k9vuou/desktop_audiosharing_significantly_worse_quality/,sufjanfan

My wife and I are lucky enough to be able to quarantine fully and get tested prior to the holidays, so we will be joining my parents for Christmas as usual (driving straight there, no stops, no public transit). My sister, unfortunately, cannot do this because of her job. Thus, I'd like to zoom her in for our traditional Christmas morning traditions. 

I'd like to get a microphone that will let her be able to hear everyone more clearly without us all having to be huddled around the computer. Normally we all sit in a semi-circle around the tree, and I'd love to be able to just kind of stick the computer in her usual spot? 

Seems like there's a lot of options out there, but I'm not sure which would be best. Any opinions?

I'm new to this sub and I've a big technical problem. 

I've been following or giving classes on this program since March (first lockdown in my country) on this exact same rig, only thing I added was a secondary hard drive but Zoom is installed on my main SSD. I never had any big crashes, rarely the program closing on its own in April I think. 

Problem : Since this morning the program keeps closing randomly or just completely locks my PC (one of screen show a static color and the other just displays black) every 2 minutes. Everything is fine on my PC I never had problems on my heavy workloads for work, I even played 15h of Cyberpunk 2077 since release without any crashes. 

  
Solutions I tried : Graphic drivers are up to date, I reinstalled them an hour ago. Zoom is also on a fresh install, I downloaded the new client from the official website. And of course I tried stopping every program running in the background (even random updates with the taskmanager). No results with all...

Is this a known bug ? Do you have any recommandations on what to do ?

2020-12-12 20:49:20,"As a host, if I spotlight someone in Zoom, how can I stop participants from navigating to the gallery view?","I have a client who is insisting on using a regular zoom meeting rather than a webinar, so we're trying to lock it down as much as possible. 


We can globally mute everyone upon entry, we can disable peoples video upon entry (and leave the ones enabled that we need). We can request to unmute those guys too.



We can also spotlight the right ones, which shows all the participants the important people. However, that only works if the participants remain in *active speaker* view. If they change to gallery view, they'll miss all the pointless hard work we're doing spotlighting people.


Is there anyway to get around that in a regular zoom meeting?


Yes. I'm aware a webinar would be easier. But I'm hoping y'all understand what it's like to work with clients who have more money than sense, or in this case, a lack of sense and no money!",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kbokwv/as_a_host_if_i_spotlight_someone_in_zoom_how_can/,Hypohamish

2020-12-15 00:02:06,Zoom speaker problem.,"So I'm having serious audio problems on Zoom right now. I'm on a MacBook Air IOS ver 10.15.3. Every once in a while (Usually once every 2 days) there will be a massive random lagspike. It usually lasts around 2 minutes but during it I am unable to do anything. Everything including the mouse will freeze up. 

After a few minutes everything unfreezes and Zoom then provides a message saying it can't detect any microphone or speaker devices to any capacity. In the audio settings for Zoom, it will not even show the computers built in speaker/microphone on the list for audio devices. I went to system preferences to see if there was anything I could do there, and there was nothing to indicate anything was wrong. I then went to Youtube to do an audio test to see if there was a problem with the speakers themselves, and also went to do a mic test, and everything seemed fine with both of them. 

The audio problem is only with Zoom and I can't seem to find any sort of fix for this to any capacity.

2020-12-15 12:43:04,Shared sound not in sync with my voice in recording? Live?,"Good evening everyone, 

I'm facing an issue that I can't really find any info about online.

I was test running a song performance because my singer friend was wondering if it would be possible to do a concert over zoom by singing at the same time that he's sharing sound. 

It sounded pretty straightforward to me, so I tested it out on zoom and recorded myself (trying to) sing over a track I produced. I'm positive I sang at the right tempo to the song. But when I went to go listen to the recording, my voice was like a second ahead of the music that I was singing over. To clarify, in the recording you can hear me start to sing before the verse part in the instrumental does. 

Link to zoom recording so you can hear for yourself: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xuuIIAl2aWFdZ61cLFrYm9rNLwaS1LJg/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xuuIIAl2aWFdZ61cLFrYm9rNLwaS1LJg/view?usp=sharing)

Link to instrumental: [https://soundcloud.com/joseflaya/shooting-stars-instrumental](https://soundcloud.com/joseflaya/shooting-stars-instrumental)

Something to note: In the recording, I notice at the beginning the instrumental sounds a bit slower than in the actual instrumental, and my voice would slow down at random times too. Maybe something is causing this?

  
**Does this mean during a live performance, people would hear the singer's voice out of sync with the audio they're sharing?** 

If anyone can test it out for themselves with their own sound, let me know how it goes!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kdeyke/shared_sound_not_in_sync_with_my_voice_in/,joseflaya

2020-12-16 21:39:50,Help creating zoom dance party on new years,"Hey everyone,

I want to organise an online dance party for my friends and anyone that wants to join. The idea is to have music playing throughout  I tested the setup so far and it looks good:

\- Everyone's mics are muted upon join but cameras are on

\- Computer 1 streams audio only then computer 2 is made the host

\- Computer 2 manually spotlights participant videos every 5-10 seconds and moderates  


Is there anything else I need to consider or take care of? Do I need to get premium to host x amount of people or for the call not to end? Any tips or advice?

Is it possible to have a virtual background on one camera, but not on another when you are using a multiple camera setup? Currently, I need to turn on and off the background when I switch camera's.

Each time switching camera's I need to turn on or off the background.

Recently I got a pop up window when I login zoom on my ubuntu 20.04. I tried to click on ""Trust anyway"" but it doesn't help, the pop up window will back immediately no matter I trust it how many times..

&amp;#x200B;

I google around but seems no one have the exact same issue like mine, normally there should have something in the end following ""Its security certificate is from "" to indicate few clues. But for my case it's nothing there at all...

What I tried to troubleshoot as below but nothing helps:

1. Update Zoom client to latest version. Or uninstall and install again.(Also delete the config file \~/.zoom)
2. Change to other networks (3 different network) in case it's caused by firewall settings
3. Turn off all proxies I configured.

Anyone have idea that anything else I can investigate also?

Our app allows you to add an extra layer of fun and productivity to the camera feed. This way you can better control meeting time, express emotions without derailing the conversation, or add some Xmas mood.

Meet Cam is in the early beta and runs on Mac only.

2020-12-22 04:55:42,Poll Report Format,"I'm preparing for a training meeting this week and am looking at using polling to gather responses on a short quiz at the end of the session.  I've done a test meeting and I feel like I must be missing something when looking at the report that is generated.  The quiz is split up into 5 polls to correspond with the slide show the presenter will be showing.  The poll report returns with each poll in a single row returned in a totally random order.  The order of the questions and responses seems random too.  There is no labelling to identify which poll is showing.  I'm really struggling to figure out a way to turn this into anything useful.  I'll probably end up linking to an outside quiz, but wanted to see if I'm just missing something somewhere.  

Here's an example of what is returned.  I added the poll labels in the first column and replaced actual content with content labels.

If I am hosting a meeting with a pre-recorded DJ set/vid playing (using camtwist, ladiocast/soundflower for audio routing), I am also trying to play this video with guests unmuted. I'm currently running into the issue that if guests are unmuted, their conversations will override the Host audio. Its sort of a DJ-social mixer thing, and it would be way cooler if they could interact in this way.

My question is: 

Is there a way for zoom to prioritize audio for the meeting's host, but also allow for guests to be unmuted?

I just started looking into QoS DSCP thing but it seems that it is more related to network priority (if I'm understanding it correctly).

If anyone has run into this issue before, I would love to know how you found a workaround other than a forced 'mute all participants.'

&amp;#x200B;

I teach in uni and lately I've been doing it via Zoom. The usual process is to have a live lecture and then  uploading the recorded video to the server for future reference. I did it fairly successfully for two semesters, no issues so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I teach a more mathematical course, where I need the whiteboard. I tried working with my whiteboard at home, but my PC camera sucks and that doesn't work. My solution was to connect to the meeting from my phone, as a participant, pinning that video for everybody, turning PC camera off and basically showing the video of my phone as the main video. That works well for the live lecture - phone's camera is great. However, in the recording, the picture is very blurry and they cannot read from the board. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think it's solvable? I tried looking for settings in both the phone and the PC, couldn't find the culprit line.

2020-12-23 17:14:14,zoom becoming shady,"okay i would like to start by getting this out of the way... most of the information i am sharing is just based on observation and i am seeking fact or truth. 

intro: by now im sure everyone has heard of breakout rooms (if you are a student). they are a great tool used to group people up to have mini discussions. i didn’t think much of it at the beginning until I recently had a weird encounter in one of my classes.

meat of the story: so in my class my teacher decided to break us up into the usual groups but that day was just an odd day. the principal (note high-school student) was in our class which didn’t surprise me one bit because normally that person (gender disclosed) would come in a class during the regular school year to “assess” teachers. sometimes they come in because students have been acting weird and they need to check it out. so as we progressed into our “assignment” of the day our teacher put us into breakout rooms. i remember that we were placed in a breakout room, but the principal was also in it. for me the oddest part was their camera was off. not on off. normally my friends started to text each other abt it because nobody wanted to slip up and text each other but it just felt super odd. what made the situation even more weird was that “they” would slip in and out of all the rooms without warning or an intro question. the part that set me off was why wouldn’t they have their camera on? surely the educators want to portray themselves and be seen, but this was odd especially for the “head” of the school. overall this is an event i will not forgot regarding highschool.

why I think zoom is a little shady: this whole situation made me pause and reflect on it now. personally I do think there needs to be some sort of notification (sounds buzz or more apparent notification) when a user enters a breakout room. i just feel like instead of being monitored on the down low, being made aware is better. also part of me wonders if this is done on purpose knowing that the minor pop-up “someone has joined ur room”. why implement such a small notification?

overall: this could be that my school is doing shady stuff and im just sus of the situation in general. but I do think that it is odd that it is hard to be notified in this situation and zoom should fix that element. it just tickles me the wrong way.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kipvsg/zoom_becoming_shady/,andrewhunter-

2020-12-25 03:28:12,Zoom travaillerait sur la création de ses propres applications de messagerie et de calendrier,"&amp;#x200B;

Zoom est devenu l'une des plates-formes de conférence les plus populaires, à la fois pour un usage privé et professionnel. La pandémie COVID-19 en cours n'a fait qu'alimenter la renommée de l'application, lui faisant passer plus de[ 500 millions de téléchargements](https://www.saidapartage.com/2020/11/zoom-maintenant-autant-dinstallations.html) sur le Play Store.

Cependant, maintenant que les vaccins commencent à être distribués aux masses, la perspective de retourner au bureau augmente. Dans cet esprit, Zoom ne veut pas que les gens l'oublient et préfère que les entreprises continuent à l'utiliser au quotidien. On dit que la société travaille au développement de sa propre suite de productivité, qui pourrait inclure des solutions de messagerie électronique, de calendrier et même de messagerie instantanée.

Selon The Information, des personnes proches du PDG de Zoom, Eric Yuan, ont révélé que la société travaillait actuellement sur un client de messagerie Web et envisageait également de créer une application de calendrier. Celles-ci auraient été développées en pensant à la «prochaine génération» de courrier électronique, au lieu de simplement copier ce que Google et Microsoft proposent déjà. Quelle que soit l'approche, la création d'une suite de productivité complète permettrait à Zoom d'être en concurrence directe avec les deux leaders du marché, du moins en ce qui concerne la gestion des e-mails, du calendrier et des réunions en ligne.

En outre, Zoom est également censé mettre davantage l'accent sur la messagerie, bien qu'il ne soit pas clair s'il construira un produit qui rivalisera avec Teams et Slack ou améliorera simplement les fonctionnalités de chat intégrées dans les réunions en ligne. Cela étant dit, avec la reprise par Salesforce de Slack, la société voudra peut-être se développer dans la messagerie complète, offrant une alternative aux entreprises qui ne souhaitent peut-être pas combiner les services d'un trop grand nombre de fournisseurs.

Enfin, The Information mentionne que la feuille de route des produits de Zoom comprend des services d'annuaire, ce qui indique clairement que l'entreprise va créer une suite complète ciblant les entreprises, qui pourrait intégrer tout ce dont elles ont besoin pour faire un travaille cordonner  .

Même si ces produits en sont encore à leurs premiers stades de développement et pourraient même ne pas être commercialisés, Zoom devrait commencer à les proposer au premier trimestre 2021, potentiellement sous forme de versions préliminaires. Cela étant dit, Zoom est connu pour fonctionner de manière transparente avec une large gamme de logiciels , notamment Slack, Outlook et Asana, et l'intégration avec ces outils continuera probablement à être prise en charge dans un avenir prévisible, en particulier parce que la plupart des logiciels existants les clients d'entreprise ne passeraient pas à sa suite de productivité avant un certain temps, voire jamais.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kjl7ha/zoom_travaillerait_sur_la_création_de_ses_propres/,benaissa17b

As a member of the commonwealth I share the tradition of having watched the Queen's speech with my  Grandma every Christmas morning since I was born. Obviously, things are different this year.

The simple solution is for us each to have the speech on another screen during the call, but I'm wondering if there is a way to add a youtube live stream to the Zoom as another member. It would be nice if we were watching it together in sync and not staring away from the screen while doing so. I also want to make this as easy as possible for her as she is 91. She is fine using an ipad and running Zoom, but, you know.

All of my googling points me to instructions on how to live stream from Zoom to youtube. I need the opposite.

Windows treats as 3 parts, Headphones, Headset, Microphone.

Pretty sure I always used Headphones for System Settings, along with being the Zoom audio device.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, whenever I try; sounds besides Zoom are muted.

If I set System and Zoom to Headset, I can hear everything again.

EXCEPT, the System sounds (videos im watching in the background) now sound like crap.

I'm used to hearing other people in this way, but videos had never sound like they are inside a tin can.

Now they do.

&amp;#x200B;

This has completely thrown off my understanding off audio devices.

If on headphones Video quality is normal, but on headsets it's different...

I take that as there being two separate speakers, one high quality for headphones, and one crap quality for headset.

How does that make any sense?

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried re-installing drivers and re-installing Zoom.

**Why**: Zoom’s had a great year. Revenue quadrupled. Stock price up 500%. But it fears what will happen when its heydays end? After the pandemic, people wouldn’t want to WFH anymore. Revenue might be worse than before.

**Why email and calendar service could be a good step forward:**

* **Future-proof**: No. of WFH meetings will go down but email and calendars aren’t going anywhere in the foreseeable future.
* **Useful Bundling**: Meetings, email and calendar are related to each other. Zoom can make it all work together. You schedule a meeting on Zoom, it goes automatically to your Zoom calendar and Zoom emails details to everyone else. Synchronisation might make for a good reason for people to adopt Zoom’s products.
* **Other big players already do this**: Zoom’s main competitors—Google and Microsoft—already have email and calendar apps of their own.

**For the future**: Zoom wants to make a full enterprise app suite. If Zoom moves fast and makes a good reason for people to use these things, it might be the top email and calendar soon.

2021-01-01 09:00:04,"C'mon, Zoom, provide support if you claim to offer it! (Where's the support I paid for?)","Ok, a bit of a rant for sure. Hopefully someone at Zoom will see this and make some changes.

This is about the 3rd of 4th post I've made about the topic. I'm still miffed.

I've had a Pro Zoom account since March. Most of the time, it works great. I've had a number of technical issues along the way (I'm not technically illiterate - problems with the software working properly from time to time).

Zoom is great and works better than any of the other major platforms out there. I spent a week testing them all and Zoom simply works more flawlessly, less lag, better UI and integration with other software/hardware, like the Elgato Streamdeck.

For the past 5 months or so (the length I've been checking), the Zoom support site continues to say that Pro account users will receive support through their web resources and [online support tickets](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362003). EVERY single time I submit a support ticket, it is automatically closed and marked as ""solved"" with the reason, ""meh, this pandemic is on"". It's misleading. All they need to do is remove the link to submit a ticket and remove the wording that they offer any sort of support in any manner, other than their online help articles, which aren't helpful if you've got technical issues. In other words, the online help articles are excellent at educating you about Zoom's features and how to use them, but if those features suddenly go missing or aren't working as they should (or at all), then it's pretty much crickets on their help articles. Have you tried their little bot to help you out? It's maddening, because when I type in my problem, it gives me answers that don't solve the issue and then when I re-word it, it gives me the same answers and then says, ""I don't understand your problem, please word it differently."" I've worded it 5 or 6 ways it comes up with the same ""solutions"" that solve nothing.

It really bugs me they mark the ticket as ""solved"". Does their PR department know about this? I seriously wanted to ditch Zoom for greener pastures based upon their total lack of technical support but the competitor's products all pale in comparison from my use case.

I don't get why they can't provide support or at least be honest about what they do offer. If you're a paying Pro account holder - no support for you! When I've contacted support of their competitors, they were very responsive and seemed very interested in helping me solve the issue at hand. Why can't Zoom hire enough people to provide support? I mean, why can their competitors provide support, but Zoom can't? Pandemic making it hard to hire people - well I assume everyone is Working from Home anyways, so why is this not possible, pandemic or not?

I must be one person of millions feeling the same frustration.",1.0,1.0,1.0,23.0,/r/Zoom/comments/ko1zuv/cmon_zoom_provide_support_if_you_claim_to_offer/,bombadil1564

2021-01-01 23:34:14,Any way to extract/zoom in on one screen from Zoom recording in gallery view?,"Hi everyone!

I had a small Zoom wedding last night. It was recorded in gallery view as well as speaker view - however speaker view only captured the groom and I's audio, as we were using a muted cell phone to film video + a laptop with the video turned off to record audio. This gave the guests the best combination of AV without introducing any feedback. Gallery view captured us visually as a small thumbnail - I opted not to spotlight our video so the recordings would capture all of the guests, and so they could see all of each other.

I'm wondering if there's any way to enlarge/zoom in on our thumbnail to get a better view for a separate video recording, or better yet access our visual feed and separate it from the group. All good if not, this ceremony was really for the guests.

Thank you!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kod4jq/any_way_to_extractzoom_in_on_one_screen_from_zoom/,lilwanderluster
2021-01-01 23:57:40,"Face looks red on Zoom, but not anywhere else","Hi! I recently got an external webcam for my second monitor so I can use it as my main monitor rather than my laptop. I've noticed that my face now looks quite red in Zoom, much redder than it ever did with my laptop camera. I thought it was a quality issue with the webcam (since it's a cheap one), but it seems that this effect is only pronounced in Zoom and isn't very noticeable in the Windows camera program or when I filter the video through an external program like XSplit VCam, which I use to have virtual backgrounds outside of Zoom. Filtering the video like this is a solution, but I'd rather not do this if possible because it's complicated and can be buggy. 

Has anyone else had this issue? I've tried turning the ""touch up my appearance"" and ""adjust for low light"" features on and off, but these don't change the redness. Thanks in advance!",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kodi6m/face_looks_red_on_zoom_but_not_anywhere_else/,pm_me_pm_speeches

Is a device like the Cam Link going to be good/fast enough not to lag and be smooth for Zoom? Are there cheaper options that do the same thing? I see lots of ~$20 USB video capture devices; are they essentially the same thing?

Also, maybe I should just drop the $100 for a c922 instead? The video quality is lower, but it's not bad and the whole thing is a good bit simpler.

Is there any way to get Zoom to NOT hijack my speakers? Also since the speakers without audio enhancement software is so quiet and low quality, I can barely hear what my teacher is speaking.

2021-01-05 07:02:43,Going crazy over randomly being unable to unmute,"I've been doing a lot of performance workshops and rehearsals over Zoom, and it's constantly a crap shoot as to whether I'll be able to be heard once the host unmutes me. This is only an issue if I've been sitting on mute for awhile.
 For instance, the  group I rehearsed with today mutes everyone before and after their turn to perform. I went second today, and I was able to unmute just fine. But about 40 minutes later, when the host unmuted me (the icon showed I was unmuted, in addition to clicking ""okay"" when Zoom told me that the host was unmuting me), I couldn't be heard. This happens CONSTANTLY and while it's generally just an annoyance, there are instances coming up where it cannot do this, period, because the calls are very important.

I did notice when I plugged in my Blue Yeti for a call a few weeks ago, I didn't have that issue. However, it could have been pure luck. I've googled this issue and articles only cover how to mute and unmute, not this weird problem.

These are the supposed ports, but how static can I depend these to be.

There's the obvious zoom.us, that will resolve to the proper IP address according to it's DNS resolving, (of which I can't use because it needs to be a number), but all the endless IP addresses, how static are they?

I'm going to assume that they're going to be Amazon Web Services, so can they possibly shift?

Right now I can only prioritize Zoom traffic using UDP and port rules (primarily 8801) to classify possible zoom traffic.  I don't use more indepth rules because I have a simple consumer router.

I can't track all users on the network when they use Zoom.

Sometimes the reported ports used with the classification are correct, and more of the times just the first or second octect match up, and the 3rd and 4th are something completely random.

The lastest call I think is a Zoom call just matches the first octect.

It always matches the first octect which is about a 2 in 5 chance of that happening.  So it seems at the very least that the main servers are still being used, but internally, routed differently.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kr8tmn/static_ips_for_zoom_traffic_to_configure_qos_for/,qqererer

2021-01-06 06:22:19,USB foot pedal for Mac to mute/unmute Zoom?,"Has anyone set up a USB foot pedal on a Mac to mute/unmute Zoom calls?

I'm taking some language classes via zoom and the instructor has us all stay muted, but then often wants us to quickly unmute to answer questions. I can of course use the onscreen mute button, or press the space bar to temporarily unmute, or do Cmd+Shift+A to toggle mute/unmute. But sometimes we are working in a workbook and my keyboard and trackpad might be moved out of the way.

Someone suggested a foot pedal and I thought that was a great idea. It would be excellent to just be able to tap my foot to mute/unmute.  Unfortunately when I search on Amazon and other sites I find either:

1. A lot of inexpensive USB foot pedals that only work on Windows or require Windows for configuration. Some *claim* to work on Macs, but when you dig into the details you have to connect them to a Windows machine *first* in order to program them, and *then* you can connect them to a Mac (or Linux) box. I don't have a Windows box to do this.  
2. More expensive USB foot pedals designed primarily for people doing transcriptions and often having multiple buttons. These will work on Macs, but are typically up around $70 - $150 or more, which is more than I was thinking of spending.

I've also found some Bluetooth foot pedals but most seem to be aimed for music (in particular, page turning) and it's not clear they can be programmed to do other functions. I also don't really want to have another device that I have to worry about charging. The simplicity of just plugging into a USB port appeals to me. 

Anyone done anything like this on a Mac?

P.S. I've found people [building physical mute buttons](https://www.instructables.com/Zoom-Meetings-Physical-Mute-Button/), which is pretty cool, but I don't see myself having the time to do that soon.",1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kr9elm/usb_foot_pedal_for_mac_to_muteunmute_zoom/,danyork

When I'm a host on some computers, both PC and Mac, I'm able to see waiting room participants under an ""unassigned"" section in the breakout room, which allows me to assign them to break out rooms before I allow them in. However, on other computers, which are also Macs, I have to allow the participant to enter the session before they get put under the ""unassigned"" section of the breakout room. I've tried using multiple browsers and even the zoom application but I still never get the option to assign before allowing the participant in. 

I've checked all the settings and google results keep giving me ""pre-assign"" breakout rooms but that's not what I'm looking for. Has anyone else had this problem? It's driving me nuts!",1.0,1.0,0.99,6.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kriw7y/assign_participants_in_waiting_room_not_preassign/,nothingworks123

I can not get rid of the glare and reflection of the screen in my glasses when I'm on a call. You can see the screen of my laptop quite clearly reflected in my glasses. Among other problems, it totally obscures my eyes.

I'm hoping someone here might have more specific advice. Is there a particular kind of light I should get, and can you recommend exactly where I should put it (other than ""to the side"")? I am using the built-in camera in my laptop - might this be improved if I get a separate and/or high quality webcam?

I have tried utilizing the Camera Settings app that Logitech provides to fix the color issues for the camera but can't seem to get rid the issues I am facing. 

Sadly, my built in camera on my 2013 MBP has much more realistic color than these higher end external Logitech's and I want something that has a good look to it like the Eyesight does (as sad as that sounds).

2021-01-07 22:37:09,"Breakout Rooms in education - what is the most elegant way of assigning different rooms a different task, without announcing the tasks to the whole group of participants?","As in the title. Some background: I am designing seminar sessions for my tutors to teach in a large-scale undergrad course. I'm trying to make the workflow of the seminars as foolproof as possible. 

Teams of students are working on an applied assignment. They have the same analyses and questions to answer but are each using a different empirical case. These seminars are intended to have them understand the nature of these analyses better by seeing how other teams apply them - and as a bonus they also learn about the different cases used by the different teams. So each team briefly presents their case, followed by class disscussion.

I want to facilitate and steer this discussion by pre-assigning each team a question or discussion point that they should ask/discuss of the presenting team. For instance: ""In the presenting team’s discussion of X &amp; Y, pay attention to their use of independent sources of information. Compare this with sources used for your own assignment. Discuss with the presenters which of the sources used by either team was most surprising or interesting.""

FYI After each presentation, I'll be giving the teams a couple of minutes in their own (pre-assigned) breakout room to discuss the question before the plenary discussion.

Maybe I'm overthinking this, but how do I get these questions to these teams at the right time? I'd hate to send them out by e-mail before the session - it seems entirely divorced from the educational/Zoom context.

Within Zoom, is it possible to send out private messages to groups of participants - for instance to participants of pre-assigned Breakout rooms?

Alternatively, maybe it's nice to start the session with Breakout rooms already active - this gives students a couple of minutes to say hi and chat within teams before moving on to the actual class. If I do this, maybe the tutor could drop the questions in each of the seperate chats of the breakouts. But will this chat remain accessible to participants once they enter the main room?

Curious whether this question is recognizable and what other solutions people have come up with.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kseh0t/breakout_rooms_in_education_what_is_the_most/,100011101011
2021-01-07 22:48:49,Huge Gap in Co-host controls,My company uses zoom for large meetings on a regular basis. We often use break-out rooms. Only giving the host control of break rooms is a huge gap in co-host controls. The main reason many hosts need co-hosts in their large meetings is helping getting people assigned to break out rooms.,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/Zoom/comments/ksep41/huge_gap_in_cohost_controls/,coolguycolorado
2021-01-07 23:06:42,Green tint fix," 

## Upcoming Release

Details about upcoming releases will be posted as they become available.

### January 11, 2021 version TBD

#### Changes to existing features

&amp;#x200B;

* **Blocking or warning of unencrypted traffic**   
All  unencrypted Zoom traffic will be blocked from connecting to meetings or  webinars. Other external unencrypted traffic, such as phone dial-in and  RTMP streaming, will be allowed, but warn all participants that the  meeting is not entirely encrypted.

#### New and enhanced features

&amp;#x200B;

* General features  
   * **Additional MSI/GPO option**   
      * **Do Not Disturb when sharing** \- EnableDoNotDisturbInSharing  
Enabled by default, admins can deploy the client with more control over the **Silence system notifications when sharing desktop** desktop client setting, which silences Zoom notifications and sets your Zoom status to Do Not Disturb.
      * **Enforce internal meeting authentication** \- SetDevicePolicyToken  
Account  admins can deploy a more nuanced authentication and restricted account  profile, forcing their users to be authenticated for internal meetings,  while allowing users to join external meetings with the security  settings put in place by the external account.
* Meeting features  
   * **Host can admit participants from the Waiting Room while within a Breakout Room**   
Host  is notified of participants in the Waiting Room, even while currently  in a Breakout Room. The host can admit each participant one at a time,  or all at once. If pre-assignments for breakout rooms are active,  participants will be asked to join their pre-assigned breakout rooms.  Otherwise, the host can assign participants directly to the breakout  room of their choosing.

#### Resolved Issues

&amp;#x200B;

* Resolved an issue with green tint on users videos seen by other participants
* Security enhancements
* Minor bug fixes

I purchased an Aukey webcam during Black Friday. But, really never used it with Zoom until today because the person I was connecting with had a preference for that.

In FaceTime the webcam is reasonably wide, though doesn't seem to be as tight as a Logitech c920. But, when I open Zoom, the shot is considerably wider, which I'm not happy about.

2021-01-09 04:52:37,Anyone else have trouble assigning breakout rooms while people are joining meeting and self-selecting breakout rooms.,"Zoom experts, I'm hoping you can help me solve this frustrating problem where people get assigned into the wrong breakout room. 

I hold a weekly team trivia game with 50+ users and \~20 breakout rooms. When people join the main meeting room during the first 5-10 minutes of the meeting before the game begins, they have the option of self-selecting the breakout room associated with their team. During this ""welcome"" period, I  do not send them into the breakout room automatically.

To save time and help the noobs with the room assignment, I assign people into their rooms on the fly. Many of them include their team number in their display name, and I know a lot of them, so it's fast and easy for me. **Here's the problem:** when clicking ""Assign to"" on one of the unassigned persons, multiple participants get highlighted and occasionally the wrong person is assigned. I think this happens because the ""Unassigned"" section is fluid and constantly changing as some people self-assign their room, while other people are accepted into the meeting from the waiting room. Some users end up getting re-assigned to another room as they're either selecting the room themselves, or have been assigned by me but haven't clicked over to the room yet (remember, I do not send them automatically during this preocess.)  


All in all, it's confusing some of the players, and delaying the start of the game as they come back into the main room and tell me they were put into the wrong room. Does anyone know a way to prevent this issue? I'm using Zoom 5.4.7 on a Mac. Thanks!",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/ktbi8r/anyone_else_have_trouble_assigning_breakout_rooms/,velospeed

2021-01-10 04:37:50,Question about Zoom 1080p,"Hello,

Does anyone have any insight into this Zoom issue? I am able to host a meeting and send video at 1080p. Users are also able to join the meeting and receive video at 1080p. If a user with an older computer joins the meeting and goes to full screen/active speaker view, that user receives only 720p. That’s fine; it must reflect a limitation of their computer. But the strange and problematic thing is that when they start receiving that 720p feed, others in the meeting start receiving only 720p (rather than 1080p) as well. 

Has anyone else experienced this? And any ideas about how to fix it? It will mostly defeat the point of the 1080p video for me if the stream downgrades to 720p whenever anyone in the meeting can receive only 720p.

2021-01-10 20:35:15,Zoom Bluetooth audio on Windows works only when playing audio in another application,"I've already seen myself and in various forums that Zoom has several quirks with audio, and Bluetooth in particular. For some reason it seems that Zoom decides on its own which audio device and settings to use and doesn't respect systemwide settings (despite the ""same as system"" option in Zoom's audio settings).

The strange behavior I'm seeing now is when I try to use a Bluetooth speaker on my Windows laptop, I hear no audio at all. If I go to the Zoom audio settings, whether I select ""same as system"" or explicitly the Bluetooth speaker, and click ""test audio"", I see the volume bar is moving but I hear nothing. However, by chance I discovered that if I play audio in some other application (say, open a Youtube video in Chrome or play music in Spotify) both that application's and Zoom's audio come through the speaker. The wonky workaround I've arrived at is to play a muted Youtube video.

All audio cuts out, coming neither to the AirPods or the iPad speakers. My video freezes, no microphones work, but I can still see everyone else’s video just fine. This happens when I already had the AirPods in my ears and listening to something on my phone, but then try to switch to the iPad. It also happens if all I do is remove the AirPods from their case, whether I’ve been using my phone or not. The only thing that fixes anything is to leave the Zoom call and rejoin the call, which is super annoying.

If I start the call AFTER I’ve already had the AirPods in my ears and connected to the iPad there’s no issue. But my wife works from home and there are times when I need to suddenly pop them in to get some privacy, so I can’t do that every time.

In here, we started to compare the major chat and messaging features but soon realised the entire collaboration experience has to be included.  


David Maldow had already created the video conferencing matrix ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_\_zWyUMQ9SY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__zWyUMQ9SY)) so the purpose of this chart was to add in often overlooked messaging and collaboration complexities faced when evaluating new or additional tools that can appear without IT or procurement sign-off.  


Included:  


🌟 Basic chat and messaging features  
🌟 High-level security detail  
🌟 Notification management  
🌟 Guest access  
🌟 Integrations  
🌟 Messaging interoperability

They declared at the end of the meeting that they'll be putting a recording of the meeting on YouTube.

I had my real name showing in my screen so that will  presumably be on display on YouTube. I'm worried that anyone, if they have the necessary ""Google-fu"", be able to find me in the recording and discover I'm a Trump fan/dogging participant/Linux enthusiast or something.

If I create a new meeting right from the Zoom app, everything behaves normally.

It's not giving me any option not to do so, and I have to go into the Zoom app and remove this person from the meeting every time. 

Seems like this could be a HUGE security flaw. I'm glad it's happening with a co-worker and not a client. I've been through all my Zoom default settings more than once and even did a direct comparison with a co-worker so I know everything matches up and is correct.

Another thing that occurs less often is the overall audio of my zoom call to be muted, for this, I need to either increase or decrease my laptop volume so I can hear the call again.

I noticed whenever I join a zoom call, there is a popup on the middle top of my screen named ""audiosmart"" and perhaps that is the cause for this.

I have no idea what causes such issues but am most certain it has something to do with zoom as I used Messenger calls without audio mutes or other interruptions.

i have tried using an xlr mic into the audio interface so that the input source is the same for both guitar and mic but the gain is way too low on the xlr mic and my regular usb mic is much clearer

i read something about using a virtual audio cable but have no idea how to set it up",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/kx1iu2/setting_up_a_guitar_and_microphone_for_lessons_on/,SuperScrub82

2021-01-14 21:30:33,Minimum speeds for a Zoom meeting,"Hey everyone, so I’m planning on hosting a 100 person Zoom meeting where everyone will end up in breakout rooms for the majority of the time. The current plan is to do this at a hotel in a somewhat rural area, and I’m trying to figure out if I need to change locations.

I’ve been researching the minimum requirements for internet speeds, the minimum speeds I’ve found are way lower than I would have thought. So I’m curious what you all consider to been minimum requirements to have a good connection? I’ve also read that Zoom sucks if other people on the same network do a bunch streaming at the same time, would that be a factor at the hotel too?

On meeting A, they're the host (teacher) for a group of younger students.

How would they go about doing this?

However, I found a workaround where they could click to join Meeting B from their internet browser, but they only seem to be able to do so AFTER canceling the request on the desktop client to exit their current meeting.

2021-01-16 09:55:15,Navigating Videos is Painful,"Watching recorded class videos is terrible because of how other video sites have trained us. On every other site, you are able to navigate some small increment forward or backward using the directional keys. In zoom recordings these keys navigate by the strange and painful increment of 8 minutes. 

The mitigating feature for this is the 10 second increment navigational icons located on the screen that can be clicked with your mouse, but if you are listening to a video while navigating, you can only navigate for a few seconds before this menu disappears and you pause the video, full screen the video, or exit full screen. 

When re watching lectures / meetings and listening for a specific part while navigating, the process is slow and infuriating. Am I the only one this is effecting or is this legit? Any fixes?",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/ky9dup/navigating_videos_is_painful/,Jabingoe

Problem:
The button for the breakout room does not appear in the meeting on the screen of the host.

A minimum of participants must exist.

If in any case that the issue still happens for you guys.

These settings did the trick for me though I did try some part of the steps found on t his random youtube guy

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJPobR-R3p4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJPobR-R3p4)

I'm on a desktop pc so the other settings on nvidia control panel on the link above was not applicable to me.  


The issue usually would happen when someone will share his screen on zoom and this all started after that latest nvidia update (I'm on RTX 2070 Super)

Hope this helps.

2021-01-19 16:55:27,"A website to improve Zoom's chat features, made by a high-schooler","Hey everyone! As a high-school senior doing distance learning, I've noticed that many of Zoom's features could be improved. In my classes' Zoom rooms, for instance, teachers never notice that students are raising their hands because the ""raise hand"" indicator is so small.

I made a free website called Dashbrain that creates a better chat experience for Zoom in just a couple of clicks, with clearer raise-hand notifications, one-click polls, Q&amp;A features, custom group-chats (instead of just ""everyone""), and exporting the chat to a PDF. If you're interested in it, you can find the post and more details here: [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dashbrain](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dashbrain). It's entirely free, and has helped many hosts I know, so I hope you find it helpful as well.

(I'm not sure if this is allowed to be posted here. Some subreddits have rules against posting websites you've made, but this one doesn't seem to. If the post is not allowed I will remove it, but I hope some people will find it useful.)

2021-01-20 01:47:33,How can I deal with Online Class Stress from being forced to help my sister with her classes while I do mine?,"So like most people, I've been doing zoom classes for about a year now I think. Thing is that the stress of the situation is finally getting to me now, and it's mostly because I'm dealing with multiple classes at once. My family forces my to help out with my little sister's online class while I am still in my class. I'd also say that my sister's teacher hasn't adapted to zoom classes, which annoys me a lot. My sister is also very loud and annoying, as she doesn't stop yelling for me to help her in her class.   
   Here's an example of an average day for me: open my class, open my sister's class, I try to listen to my class and do work, my sister yells constantly for me to help her in class, I either help for a varying amount of time or say I don't know, I leave, I try to listen to my class or work, and it repeats until classes end.  
Juggling between everything has caused me to lose my focus in class, which hurts me and my grades. Is there anything I can do to help make these classes less stressful? I've already been getting into hobbies more as a way to de-stress, which helps, but it doesn't solve or reduce the root of the problem, which is dealing with both my sister's and my classes at the same time.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/l0ozl5/how_can_i_deal_with_online_class_stress_from/,GreenSpeen10

Last night I was connected to the 5GHz band pulling about 100MBps down, 10Mbps up, and a 9ms ping according to speedtest. I've restricted the channel for the router to an empty one, so no interference from others AFAIK. I was on a group Zoom meeting with a dozen others across the UK, and my partner who was on her mobile in the same room as me. I seemed to be the only one struggling with broadband issues. I started out on my mobile phone first, then moved to my laptop (Surface Pro 6, Windows 10) thinking it might help. I got a lot of stuttering, Zoom disconnecting and restarting on its own, and low bandwidth warnings. The only issue I can think of is that my Zoom account is a work provided account (SSO login) through my university in the US. Is there a chance that Zoom was routing my data to the US and back for my meeting, causing connection issues? My partner, with the exact same phone model as me, has a regular free Zoom account and had no issues.

B = purchase 5 hosting licenses without scheduling privileges that can be shared throughout the corporation?

I had 4 guests and they all ended up with different length recordings that don’t sync up... All the content is there I assume but I’d have to go in a re-sync manually which I don’t want to do. Fortunately there’s a mixed backup and I can live with that. Anyway, learned something new and wondered if anyone had encountered the same or had any other advice for podcasts.

There are tons of error 1019's from the SAML response log. 

Sure they can wait 30 minutes and try again, but this isn't an acceptable option for many (and understandably so) they have meetings to attend. It's putting a pretty heavy burden on our tech support staff as they spend most of the day unlocking accounts.

Explanation: The 'incorrect password"" issue occurs when Zoom incorrectly interacts with SSO (single sign-on) SSO is when you are redirected to a webpage to sign in through your school or company zoom domain. SSO is used to make the action of accessing a Zoom meeting more secure and ""simpler"". Sometimes, the SSO glitches and tells you the password is incorrect despite the password being correct. 

Alternatively, you can sidestep SSO by joining the meeting through the Zoom mobile app or joining through your browser. But the mobile version and the browser version of zoom are pretty bad.

2021-01-23 20:14:59,Screen sharing - how to prevent FPS and resolution throttling?,"I have recently noticed that zoom automatically lowers frame rates and resolution when screen sharing, likely to reduce bandwidth usage.  This is unnecessary given my internet connection.  I have been through the (Windows desktop) application settings and online advice and FAQs and found nothing on this topic.  The meetings in question are being hosted by a premium user, but I personally am not one.  When the host shares, the resolution is significantly better, in spite of both of our laptops using the same 1920x1080 resolution.  I would not be surprised if this was a result of me being a free user.  Both of us, however, have the same issue with framerates being throttled and being reduced to 1fps when the screen is perceived by zoom as static.  In both cases there is negligible latency (&lt;50ms) and no jitter.  Is there any way to stop this from happening, or is it just something zoom does because it's a ""well designed program"" working as intended?  My personal theory on this is that it is done to prevent backend load on the zoom servers, but it's an absolute nightmare for my purposes.

2021-01-24 15:18:48,How exactly do I host a Zoom webinar (step by step)?,"I'm holding a Zoom Webinar for a conference, involving 200 attendees and 5 speakers (panelists). The speakers will individually deliver a one hour talk/presentation one one at a time, and will be introduced by my cohost.

My role is only to operate the Zoom Webinar platform. I'm therefore 'invisible' to the attendees, just working the backend of the platform to ensure the transitions from my cohost (who's 'chairing' the event, introducing speakers etc) to the speakers are seamless.

Only problem is I don't know how to work the platform, and all tutorials I've found aren't specific enough. If anyone could possibly advise and answer my questions I'd be very grateful.

1. Am I correct in thinking I send the same Webinar join link to both attendees and speakers - then at the start of the conference while my cohost is introducing the speaker, I promote the speaker from 'attendee' to 'panelists'? They can then unmute themselves and show their video to give their presentation?

2. After I've promoted the speaker to 'Panelist' should I then demote my co-host to 'attendee'? Or is it typically best they merely mute themselves and turn off their video until the speaker is finished? What is the best thing to do with this?

3. Can I check if my step by step understanding for starting the conference and the transitions is correct:

1) I start the event at its start time
2) immediately I promote my cohost to 'panellist' who then gives a brief opening speech to welcome the attendees before introducing the first speaker
3) the first speaker would have joined the event as an attendee. While my cohost is giving his opening speech, I find the first speaker in the attendee list, and I promote them to 'panellist'
4) The first speaker then sits with their microphone and video off while until my cohost introduces the speaker
5) Once introduced, the first speaker simply unmutes himself, turns on his video and delivers his talk/presentation
6) my cohost then mutes himself and turns off his video
7) Speaker talks for an hour
8) At the end of the talk, my cohost unmutes and turns on his video to thank the speaker, and I demote the speaker back to an attendee
9) repeats for the next speaker 

Does this sound like right way to do it?

Apologies if these are n00b questions, I'm just very unfamiliar with it all and rather nervous about getting it wrong.

Yesterday I taught a Zoom meditation class. At the same time, I was recording audio of the class (just my words) the students were on mute.

I was recording with Garageband and it was playing some soothing meditation music.

My hope was that the students could hear my voice ( through a microphone) and the soothing background music - and they could!

BUT in my recording, my mic was also picking up the sound of the background music through my speakers. 

So in an attempt to overcome this, I plugged in some headphones to my computer and rested them down. Just so I could avoid the background music being picked up by my mic - BUT it stopped the students being able to hear the background music.

Question - is there a way to have backng music played just to the students and not to me?

I plan to use interpretation during an interactive seminar (meeting). Involved are 3 Malaysian resource speakers, Malaysian trainees, and the English-speaking core team including facilitators, support, etc. There will be 1 interpreter who'll switch between the 2 languages.

I was wondering if it would be better for the core team to select English or just turn off interpretation (so they'll all be in the main channel/original audio), or to just choose what setup they prefer. Any suggestions on the best way to go about this? Or what the advantages and disadvantages are? Is requiring *everyone* to select a language (and sticking to it for the most part, although toggling back and forth from time to time is okay) a good idea in the first place, e.g., Malaysian trainees and speakers in the Malaysian language channel and English-speaking core team in the English channel? 

I haven't completely wrapped my mind around language channels and their implications for some reason. I also saw an interpreter say they had trouble going back to the main channel, which seems to be an issue especially if the core team is in the main channel and they all need to coordinate?

We each lead a different class, but co- facilitate the workshops together ( so we are always in the same classes at the same time but one person is the lead person for that class). Right now our boss has us sharing the same zoom account. From what I have read this seemas like it could cause some problems and is maybe not allowed according to the terms of service but I am not sure. We will never need to schedule more than one class at a time, but I am worried it will at the very least cause confusion if we need to use different settings for each class.

I am a video editor working on a project for a school dance project with 12 different performers (woo!). I am going to have to collect and compile them and was wondering if it was possible to have each performer record their own POV while in a gallery view so they can also see what the other performers are doing during the performance. If that isn't possible what would be the best way to have them record their PoV for quality sake. Also if anyone has had any similar experience and has any tips for compiling it would be helpful.

They are never allowed to disrespect a teacher in anyway. Kids will be kids. But you have no right to make 11-year-old cry because he’s not understanding. If you have an attitude and you’re not feeling good have another teacher do it or send an email out with some homework. Act your age and be a professional forgot sakes. I know it’s not easy right now for teachers either. But you inspire children and they look up to you.

I'm looking to incorporate more bonding activities (the intention being engagement, meaningful conversation, and more cultural understanding of where everyone comes from). Here's what we've done so far:

\- Trading Places (students submitted 2 pics from back home and explained the story behind them, followed by a Q&amp;A session)

\- Ungame (students picked a random number and level and were asked deep, philosophical questions that they were comfortable answering)

\- Hot Topix (we discussed the campus climate, different movements and groups, and what students were doing on campus for the outside world/local community).

Any ideas for more meaningful activities or games we can pursue that will help to bond and build relationships? I thought of 2-Minute Tours (each student will have 15 mins to make a presentation with images and text and act as a tour guide for 2 mins explaining the best places to visit in their country, the best food, and the best cultural experiences they can take part in), Bucket List talk, and taking the MB Personality Test together.

* After the screen sharing drops out, I need to exit the meeting and reenter in order to share again. 
* When sharing a PDF and scrolling through a document, the document will sometimes freeze up and stop scrolling. It scrolls on my system but users in the zoom cannot see the document scrolling.

When attempting to play music, either with simply sharing my computer audio, without sharing my screen, or when I share screen and audio, I will have the issue of the music lowering whenever people talk. Now, normally this wouldn't be an issue, but I like to use music and ambience a lot, and I wanted to know if there was a way to disable this feature. I've spent hours Googling and trying to figure this out, and was wondering if anybody knew a solution.

For clarity: When I am sharing computer audio to play music, if someone talks, whether myself or someone else, the music audio will lower and be impossible to hear. I want to disable this, if possible.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/l79idz/setting_to_fix_volume_lowering_when_people_talk/,Timber910

I am just really confused and concerned because I have already lost one of my recordings attempting to recover out of trash and do not want them to be moved to the trash anymore.

\- You present on a video call and can’t see any feedback from your team 🤐

\- Or you’re on a call when somebody else is speaking and you really want to say/add but do not want to interrupt the speaker ✋

Or maybe you just wished that video calls were more than mere 2D video frames - that you could shake hands, give your friends a high-five or a hug?🤝

We got fed up with this too and are working now to bring our normal human real-life interactions to our digital video calls, starting with our gestures and smiles.

2021-01-30 05:58:25,Miro used in Zoom meeting,"I spent some time today experimenting with Miro on zoom. I found that maybe zoom integration (with Zapps, coming in March, 2021) with Miro will make the experience a little more palatable. I found that there were really two use-cases I was interested in.

1. Sharing a miro board with observers on the zoom meeting
2. Live changing of a board with team members while observers watched you do it

I think that the value of Zoom is that it is a tool that simplifies joining and planning meetings and all the media, audio/video/file sharing and app sharing that goes along with that. 

With the success and enormous adoption of zoom, why put the video/audio, scheduling stuff into another app? If you were ever going to build a flow chart or agile project in front of a bunch of hands-off stakeholders, you would want to use a collaboration tool that everyone knows how to use and integrates with your contact list, email app etc. 

My takeaway from the experiments I did today convince me that using apps like Miro within Zoom is a natural way to collaborate beyond just talking heads. Using interactive whiteboard apps extends the overall value of Zoom and fulfills my first rule of collaboration: 'Memorialize what you share'. A good whiteboard with all of the features of a Miro would bring you pretty close to that ideal. 

My YouTube channel, ZoomExperts, will feature an intuitive walk-through of using 3 different whiteboard sharing apps within a zoom meeting. I would love feedback on that when it is published.

2021-01-30 17:01:31,Zoom Needs Easy Autocaptioning Yesterday," I’ve been doing a lot of research into autocaptioning Zoom meetings and it’s really weird that only paid Zoom accounts allow it, and the option has to be turned on by the person giving the zoom. (This means I will never have a conversation with a person I’m going to Zoom with, can you imagine; “Hey, so, umm.. do you pay for Zoom?” And why should it be on the person who needs it to have a conversation with the person needs it least?) YouTube has had auto caption capabilities for years and by now every platform ought to have a nifty button you can push. I’m amazed that auto caption can understand people better than I can in many cases. I get along pretty well with my hearing loss, but it’s weird to me that I can’t hit a little auto caption button to be able to participate in a Zoom. And that hearing folks get to gatekeep. I’ve learned a couple of work arounds from a new group I joined, but as of yet I’ve downloaded 3 apps and have not yet been able to set them up to work. Major corporations really cling to the wording in the American Disabilities act that says captioning applies to things being televised. In a world where tv is the screen I watch the least, it’s starting to get annoying. And it’s crazy right? It’s 2021 and autocaption is so much better than those people they hire to caption the TV news.",1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,/r/Zoom/comments/l8hrrc/zoom_needs_easy_autocaptioning_yesterday/,Artcricket

2021-01-31 04:09:50,Complex (but potentially noob) Zoom Video question,"Hello,

So I'm trying to set up a zoom call with the following elements:  
1. there's a teacher / lecturer  
2. there are in-person class members  
3. there are virtual class members  
4. whenever anyone comments, in-person or virtual, the sound is sent over Zoom.  The people in-person hear the sound over the building/room audio.  The people connected virtually hear it in the normal way.  
5. when virtual people comment, like normal, the video focuses on them. When the teacher comments, the video focuses on him/her.  When the in-person class members comment, the video focuses on them.

Currently I have worked out everything except step #5.  The virtual people show up like normal, but for the in-person people I'm at a bit of a loss.  The main constraint is that the computer running the Zoom session is a MacBook Pro with a built-in webcam.  I've figured out how to use my phone and my tablet as alternative video sources (so one pointed at the class and the other at the lecturer), and Command-shift-N will switch between video sources; however, the laptop video is also in the series of video inputs to shift through, and that's no good.  I don't want the laptop operator to be visible; also, when I Command-shift-N to the built-in camera, it takes an additional second or so to switch (but switching to the other camera sources is instantaneous), and THEN I can continue through the cycle.  In other words, the built-in camera is really in the way of me toggling between the two input sources.

So what am I asking?  Here are some equivalent questions:  
1. Is there a way to disable ONLY the built-in camera?  Removing Zoom's access to the camera in the privacy settings disables all of my camera inputs.  
2. Is there a way to just toggle between two inputs and skip the built-in camera input?  
3. Is there a better way to share the two inputs that would either automatically focus on the source of the sound (though this should be indistinguishable--sound from the in-person class members and the teacher is currently being combined with a mixer before hitting Zoom), or somehow combine the two video sources into one Zoom video?  Having a permanent screen share would MAYBE be an option, except the teacher will likely want to share other things on the screen--toggling the video source is my current favorite potential ability.  
4. Under the Share Screen menu there is an ""Advanced"" tab.  There is a ""Content from 2nd Camera"" option.  If I could fit that to a key command or BetterTouchTool sequence, that would work.  The class would be the 2nd camera and when they spoke, the computer operator would switch to them.

Sooooo sorry for the length of this.  I could use a lesson in brevity! 🤦‍♂️

2021-01-31 05:55:03,I somehow went over 40 minutes on a free account?,"I had a birthday Zoom with my family on Thursday, which I hosted, and despite having a free account and never giving Zoom any payment info, we went over 40 minutes.

Looking at previous posts on the subreddit, there's a bit of conflicting information, but apparently you get unlimited for the first time/times hosting.

1. Is it the first time, or first few times, and if it's the first few, is there any way of predicting when it will start caring about the limit?
2. Does it count by total number of meetings I hosted, or just the number of meetings I hosted that went over 40 minutes?

The first pair worked fine on my MacBook Pro &amp; Zoom, albeit the actual volume was quite low while on Zoom calls.

However, with my replacement pair, using Zoom messes up the quality of ALL audio.

Some examples:

* I am listening to a Youtube video or Netflix, which sounds fine, and then when I get onto a Zoom call, the sound quality instantly sounds like a tin can. It switches back to normal after I leave the meeting.
* I am listening to Spotify. I enter a Zoom call, and my Spotify plays for 2 secs before pausing itself again. Doesn't stop doing this until I leave Zoom.

I've updated my Zoom, restarted my computer, cycled through switching on &amp; off ANC, cleared space on my hard drive, my speaker &amp; mike setting are Same As System, and am on auto echo cancellation. Can someone tell me whats going on?

EDIT: The audio quality goes back to normal when I select my MacBook Pro Microphone but keep my earbuds as speakers. I suspect this has to do with the bluetooth capacity at its limit on Zoom or on my computer?

2021-02-01 22:56:44,Easiest way to live stream larger event with presenter and slides,"Totally new to live streaming.  I have monthly business related meetings for about 80-120 people who attend in person once we get through COVID.  We have had good success live streaming typical zoom meetings during COVID, so I would like to live stream and record the in-person meetings once we start having them again. The zoom meetings during covid has been showing the slides on screen with the presenter in the little video box.  Terrible presentation, however we have been providing good content.

The typical meeting has a person presenting from a stage or the front of the room using powerpoint slides that are shown on a large screen.  My thought is to use two PTZ cameras.  One would stay focused on the screen to show the slides.  The other would be on the presenter.  Then we could flip between the two views, most of the time focused on the presenter.  I was considering the Blackmagic Design  ATEM Mini  to bring one camera feed into Zoom.  If I needed to pan/tilt/zoom I would use the camera remotes.

For audio I was planning to use two of the Blue Yeti Nano mics on either side of the podium or on either side of the presenter.  I would feed those into the Blackmagic Design  ATEM Mini.

The meetings are in a number of different facilities, so I need a setup that is flexible and changeable and easily setup.  I can't permanently mount anything.

The person running the A/V live stream will have no experience, so I am trying to keep this as simple as possible, while presenting a great live stream experience to our members.  These are all business folks, so they will all be familiar with the linking into Zoom.  I like the idea of doing this through Zoom.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I have some money to spend on hardware/software.  I need it to provide a clear and clean video and audio live stream that is easy to setup each month and easy for someone to run during the meeting.

I will want to do some minor editing to the video post production.  It seems like the BlackMagic Design ATEM mini will let me do those simple edits.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/la4vem/easiest_way_to_live_stream_larger_event_with/,NoAARPforMe

I work for a small college and am tasked with organizing a virtual student employment career fair. Normally, we fill a huge room and have department supervisors sit at a table and chat with students as they pass by, talk about open positions, hand out fliers, take names/emails of interested students. Here's what I'm thinking for a virtual format:

1. Each supervisor/department gets their own breakout room, and we'll leverage the new Zoom breakout room feature that allows participants to choose their own breakout room. So, supervisors will enter their own breakout room, and students can wander about, choosing their own room and leaving whenever needed. 
2. I'll encourage each supervisor to have at least one or two digital ""action items"" to share, i.e. links to department websites/job postings, videos, etc. that they can drop in the chat or screen share. I think they should set up a Google Form or something similar to drop in the chat for students to record their names/emails if they are interested in learning more. 
3. The event will last two hours, and we're assuming students will drop in and out at various times within the timeframe. I'm thinking I'll have supervisors expect to have a spiel that they can repeat every 15 minutes or so. 

Anyone have experience with anything similar? What went well, didn't work as well for you? Any thoughts and reactions welcome. Thanks y'all.",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/Zoom/comments/la9y3x/hosting_career_fair_via_zoom/,harri-bar-bari

2021-02-02 04:03:20,Zoom intermittently crashing when sharing my screen,"We have an ok PC running a 1060 graphics card.  The PC is running 2 UHD monitors (text / icons enlarged to 200%), and a third 1920x1080 which I use as part of a teleprompter / zoom participant viewer (this is on run off of the mother-board HDMI port).

Anyhow, it all works fine until I share the screen and then the mouse slows down and more often than not crashes.  However, when I change the UHD settings for the two monitors down to 1920x1080 - it seems to be stable.  However, the person using the PC doesn't want to change the settings each time she has a Zoom call.

I looked at the performance settings and they seem ok, but my initial thoughts was that it was the 1060 was struggling (or that Zoom couldn't handle the UHD monitor).

I could do with a bit of help, as I don't have any good fixes for this just yet. I tried ""DisplayFusion"" monitor management which looked perfect until I realised it can't change the text/icon size, so now I'm a bit stumped.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/lackoo/zoom_intermittently_crashing_when_sharing_my/,Conscious_Panda2021

2021-02-02 11:18:14,"zoom on iPad - contacts won't sync to one device (and no Auto Answer Group), but do sync to another","I've got two iPads, both are 6th gen, both newly updated to iOS 14.4, both zoom v5.4.10.  The only difference is that #1 is a MR7F2LL/A, and #2 is a MRJN2LL/A.  I can't seem to get my contacts to show up properly on #2, though they do on #1.

When I log into my zoom account on iPad #1, I see all my contacts, same as in the desktop app, including pending ones.  I also see the Auto Answer Group.  Currently, just one accepted contact and two pending.

When I log into the same zoom account on #2, all I see is the one accepted contact, no pendings, and no Auto Answer Group.  (When I add a contact from iPad #2, it shows up in the contacts list locally as ""pending"", and will also show up in the desktop app after logging out/in.  However, it never shows up on iPad #1 after logout/in.)

Turning off auto-answer in the web account settings makes the Auto Answer Group disappear from the desktop app &amp; iPad #1, after logout/in, as you would expect.  But it has no effect on iPad #2.  (Setting other profile items, such as the profile pic, does sync to both iPads.)

The whole point of this exercise is to get auto-answer working on iPad #2, as it is on #1.  But I can't get the Auto Answer Group to show up at all.  It's as if #2 were running some different version of the app, but they're both 5.4.10 (59933.0115).  I've tried uninstalling &amp; reinstalling several times.

2021-02-02 11:26:13,FIXED!!! Problem with login to Google with application,"Hello their everyone, I basically have figured out what is wrong with the ZOOM meeting application once you want to sign in using a google account or even the other parts of login options. Basically what the problem is that its very simple, The problem that was happening its because ZOOM only offers google chrome as their browser option to let people login, if  you aren't using Google Chrome browser as default and are using other browsers example like Mozilla, Safari, Opera etc... , the program will refuse to login, to fix this but before fixing, you have to check that zoom is close fully and does not appear in task manager or somewhere else. To fix this you have to do is

1. Go to your Search and type Settings.
2. Open your settings and go to Apps.
3. Click on default apps.
4. Scroll down until you see a option says ""Web Browser""
5. Click on that option, and choose ""Google Chrome"" as your default browser, Warning !! this will make Google Chrome as the default browser to be used instead of using any other etc browser but whats good about it , after doing all that !! , you can return and change it to your favorite browser that you had before doing all those steps. 
6. Now go open Zoom, and dont sign in THE page given !! Even if the browser is Google Chrome""at first when you do that, the problem will happen, you have to close that page, and go to the program, Which their is 2 option ""ZOOM MEETING"" or ""Sign In"", Click on ""Sign In"" and then locate ""Sign in using Google"".
7. Now you will see that Google Chrome will appear as  your browser default that you are going to use, you need to Put your information, and then click ""Sign In"", after that the program will be reloading, and their we go, you have logged in using your Zoom account share with Google or even the other options.
8. This is very important..., Many people can still not use the application because of that problem, and i am one of them, but today i discover it by myself the program whats wrong with it and why is it only Google Chrome browser it works with. Anyway i hope this will help many people to fix their problem, and i look forward that other browsers option should be allowed, because its annoying when example i use Mozilla Firefox, i have to do the some steps again to be able to login when i close the application.",1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/lam9j3/fixed_problem_with_login_to_google_with/,ramyonk21

My instructor struggles with making pre-made breakout rooms work in her class.

2021-02-03 01:01:03,Difficulty with getting both video and audio working on Zoom in browser.,"Ubuntu 20.04 ESR / Debian Buster – behaviour is consistent between the systems.

When using Chromium-based browsers, audio works but I can’t see the video from the other participants. IIRC it’s just a big blank green box.

When using Zoom in Firefox baremetal, audio doesn’t work. It’ll say that audio is connected, but there is no sound. This happens even if I use a fresh Firefox binary with default settings and no user.js, which shouldn’t be perturbed at all by system settings. /etc/firefox is also empty so there should be no trouble from there.

However, if I use Zoom in Firefox in a VM (Ubuntu or Debian), audio and video both work out of the box.

Any ideas what could be causing this difference in behaviour?

Unfortunately, due to an unrelated technical issue, I cannot pass through my webcam to the VM.

As a workaround, I can join a call twice (once baremetal Firefox for video, once in Chromium or VM for audio). The downside of this is that it registers me in Zoom as two separate users, so if I talk it focuses on my name rather than my video. Is there any way around this, to merge the two user sessions?

2021-02-04 03:41:42,Zoom chat notification pop ups suppressed when in Zoom meeting,"***TL;DR: Zoom Chat IM notifications are suppressed when in a Zoom Meeting***

Hopefully I can explain this...

Our company uses Zoom Business. I'm an admin, but not the owner. We use Zoom Chat as our main IM client and Zoom Meetings as our main meeting platform. I know the difference between in-meeting messaging and the main IM chat. I'm using Zoom 5.5.1 (upgraded today from 5.4.9) on Windows 10 with the **Use dual monitors** feature enabled. The gallery is on my laptop's screen (Windows monitor 1) where the camera is located and Zoom notifications appear. The shared screen is on another monitor (typically Windows monitor 2, but occasionally 3).

Zoom Chat notification pop-ups work as expected. I get all the notifications all the time - as long as I'm not in a meeting. As soon as I'm in a Zoom Meeting, the pop-ups and audio notification stop. Yes, the Zoom icon in my Notification Area gets a little red dot, but I'm full-screen in the meeting, so it's effectively invisible. Zoom Meeting chat notifications continue to work as expected. ***Bottom line: All Zoom Chat IM notifications are effectively suppressed when in a meeting, and that's a problem.***

In **Settings** \&gt; **Chat** I've disabled **Mute chat notifications while I am in a meeting or internal call**:

That's the only setting I'm aware of that affects this behaviour.

2021-02-04 05:42:34,Zoom - mic going not recognized mid meeting,"I have a relatively new ASUS ZenBook UX325EA-AH77 which is only a couple months old now. I've experienced this issue twice during a meeting, both meetings were longer than my normal 1 hour meetings, where the microphone will stop working and a ""join audio"" popup appears that says ""Leave Computer Audio"" underneath ""failed to detect your microphone. Please make sure your microphone is properly connected"". 

Restarting zoom fixes the issue, but obviously requires quitting the meeting I'm in. The audio from remote participants still works (I can hear them) but my microphone stops all together. I can't figure out what's going on and if it's a problem with my hardware, a Windows issue or a Zoom issue. The fact that restarting zoom fixes the problem points me in the direction of some conflict with zoom but who knows. 

I haven't yet uninstalled the audio drivers and reinstalled them (that's my next step) but I don't really know where to go from there. And since it's so inconsistent, I'm not sure how to tell if I resolved it. Anyone else experience anything like this? 

I have had it connected to a multi-port dongle with another monitor, keyboard/mouse, headphone but I can't figure out why that would cause this issue, only sometimes, in longer meetings without being touched. 

My #1 concern is making sure it's not a hardware issue with my new computer; because that has a time limit on getting fixed (the 1 year warranty).",1.0,1.0,0.99,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/lbz5cn/zoom_mic_going_not_recognized_mid_meeting/,hail2thevict0r

For the sake of convenience, it's just a recurring meeting that uses the same link every day. I have removed students before for being continually disruptive (I can disable chat and 'unmute' abilities temporarily, but that ends up impeding other students' ability to interact).

My question is this: are students who are removed from the meeting on Tuesday, able to rejoin the next instance of the meeting on Wednesday, Thursday, etc.? When I remove a student, I don't necessarily want to ban them for life. I want them to be able to rejoin on another day.

**If this is the case**, I feel wary about simply changing the account settings to ""allow [all] removed participants to rejoin."" There was one legitimately concerning instance of an anonymous person joining the Zoom with an inappropriate photo; I removed them immediately and I want people like that to be ""banned for life"" so to speak.

If removed users are by default banned from that recurring meeting forever, is there a way to view blocked email addresses individually and unblock them?",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/lcqpum/can_removed_users_join_a_recurring_meeting_the/,chivestheconquerer

I am studying a challenging course and, because of COVID, the majority of it is done through Zoom.

Now, sometimes I may miss an important point. Then, I have to go and listen to a 4-hour lecture to find that snippet of info I missed. This is making me stressed out as I have to spend all day listening and listening.

What I need is something I can use to press record (maybe with a big button) and only record a 3 -10 minute section of the Zoom session. Yes, our lectures are 4 hours long. I may need to feed the dog or something - it could be anything that makes me miss a snippet which could be vital.

I do not mind paying for a quality program that does this and is easy to use. Of course, it needs to record video and audio. I have 1.5 terabytes of internal space to work with. It would be nice to choose the resolution (and thus file size) though.

Please would you give me recommendations on your chosen software that can do this (free or paid), as I imagine some of you may have the same problem?

I attended a Zoom meeting that had this feature once but I’m not sure if the host used Webinar and added us as Panelists? But the audience I’m using would be too big for that (85). 

We have a specific purpose for this and we want to be able to use mostly the Q&amp;A features but we also want participant video to be an option. Is that possible, or can I only have one without the other?

2021-02-10 03:37:16,"I clicked share screen and it shared the wrong screen, repeatedly.","Has anyone else had this problem? I have not seen anyone else post about it on the internet.

TLDR: I ran tech for a buddy's music presentation. When it came time to share his two virtual choir videos, Zoom kept screen sharing the wrong videos despite my telling it to share the right ones. This has never happened before, as I have successfully shared screens on other peoples presentations this semester. Why did this happen now? It was awful.

Full story:

I am in charge of tech for people's music presentations at my school, and the Zoom host. During their presentation, each student has one or two prerecorded virtual choir videos. I have done this several times this semester without any hitches, until a few minutes ago. Like usual, I had both videos open in fullscreen on my computer (in the way where you can swipe a few fingers on the trackpad to switch between screens) When it came time to share one of the videos, I clicked to select the video I wanted to play, but Zoom shared the other video. I cancelled the share and tried this 3 more times, and it kept sharing the wrong video. I finally took the video I needed and clicked it out of fullscreen, then it shared properly when I told Zoom to share screen again.

Then, a few minutes later I clicked to share the second video, and guess what, it shared the first video. I tried several more times, and each time the screen shared it wasn't the damn video that I had clicked on it to share. Finally, my friend giving the music presentation shared the video himself. (The whole point of my sharing it instead of him is so he could focus on singing, and I could make the transition smooth)

I feel badly that this all happened since leading music on Zoom is already hard enough as is. I know that technical difficulties like that can throw you off in an already nervous state. But I didn't actually do anything wrong myself, so I feel badly, not guilty. Zoom was glitching out by not sharing the screen I had selected. (I'm not saying that to push away blame. It's geniunely what happened, or else I wouldn't be posting here).

(I have an early 2015 MacBook Pro running iOS 10.12.6, and Zoom version 5.4.7. I need to update both my computer and Zoom, but that shouldn't be the reason why this happened because again, I have done this successfully several times before, including last week).",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/lgbg9z/i_clicked_share_screen_and_it_shared_the_wrong/,maxs507

* When they log in to Zoom meetings, their audio takes VERY long to connect (about a minute)

2021-02-11 13:01:16,"Solution to ""Sharing is paused. Bring your shared window to the front"" issue when using Powerpoint in individual window mode","I just solved this problem and thought I'd share.     If you use Powerpoint with Zoom frequently, you might prefer to show the slides in presentation mode without the view taking up your entire screen.  There is a way to do this in recent version of Powerpoint: go to Slides Show &gt; Set Up Show and choose Browsed by an Individual (window).   

This works really well, except sometimes you get an orange error in the Zoom bar saying ""Sharing is paused.  Bring your shared window to the front"".  When this happens, the presenter thinks they are advancing their slides, but the audience sees the initially shown slide only.

The solution I found is to put the slides into presentation mode **before** sharing the screen on Zoom.  And if you like to share the slides, and then stop sharing to have a group conversation, and then share the slides again, be sure not to quit out of presenter mode.  If you keep the presentation mode running continually, you will avoid the problem.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/Zoom/comments/lhde3c/solution_to_sharing_is_paused_bring_your_shared/,searchupticious

2021-02-12 07:48:11,Unstable Connection - Tried everything I can think of to fix.,"Okay, so I'll preface this by saying that im not technologically illiterate but this issues is making me second guess it.

I am using a desktop PC with great specs, hardwired into a gigabit connection (brand new modem...see below). When on a zoom call, no other internet app works on my PC. When I try and look something up for a call, or find a document online to share, the web browser does not connect. 

I continually get an 'your internet connection is unstable' warning in zoom. 

I am on zoom every day for work, and it is critical to operations. Thankfully, my laptop that is connected to the same network, running the same webcam/zoom version is functioning fine...

What I've tried to do to address this

* Upgraded internet speed
* Downgraded internet Speed
* Replaced Modem
* Reset Modem/Wireless Settings/Troubleshooting with Comcast
* Updated LAN Drivers from intel
* Updated BIOS


Other than finding another Motherboard or PC, does anyone have any ideas?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/lhycbk/unstable_connection_tried_everything_i_can_think/,mrguyfawkes

* 6th Gen iPod Touch (would have to use some paid apps to make this work).
* LG G3 (would have to use some paid apps to make this work).

Based on this, should I stick to using the current webcam, or would using the old phone be better for my purposes? My main concern is the resolution and low-megapixel count of the Generic webcam. I do realize lighting is super important as I have purchased a ring light. I just want to avoid people thinking my video quality is poor or choppy.

I am the moderator for a series of events with a bunch of participants and different presenters. In the past, I've just created a ""waiting room"" for presenters that did not want to join breakout discussions and I've remained in the main room to support late joiners or people that disconnect to jump back into rooms. However, some of the presenters I work with are quite elderly and struggle with technology so it would be much simpler if  I could just keep them in the main room so that I can chat with them and make sure they are doing alright while I continue to be available to support others.

Is this possible? I know I can join the ""waiting room"" as the host, but I like to be in the main room to field questions instead of jumping around.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/lm4zbl/holding_some_participants_in_the_main_room_during/,coffeefix_

It happens at random, for me it happens 10% of the times I minimize the window; I'd like it to happen 100% of the time.

Things we've tried, suggestions from other people:
* minimize using the button in the title-bar
* right-click on the titlebar and selecting ""minimize"" from the pop-up menu
* Click the app icon in the titlebar, selecting ""minimize"" from the pop-up menu
* left-clicking on the zoom icon in the taskbar
* rlight-clicking on the zoom icon in the taskbar, selecting ""minimize"" from the pop-up menu
* middle-clicking on the zoom icon in the taskbar
* turning on ""When closed, minimize window to the notification area instead of the task bar"" in Settings &gt; General
* turning off ""When closed, minimize window to the notification area instead of the task bar"" in Settings &gt; General

2021-02-19 00:05:10,"Zoom Won't Open/Says ""You're already in a Zoom meeting, please restart"" when trying to open","A client has had issues with Zoom between a couple of machines intermittently since last March. Seemingly at random, the Zoom client will hang when attempting to open and fail to launch, with the tray icon selectable but unable to enter options or really do anything. And generally when this happens, rebooting the PC will resolve the issue, but not always and we need to utilize the browser client to join the meeting. 

The other, related issue is all that I said above, but the error message  ""You're already in a Zoom meeting, please restart""  appears instead of Zoom flat not opening. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far the only truly successful way to resolve it is to freshly install Windows on the laptop, but I don't have the option in this particular case, so I need to actually resolve the core issue. 

Things that I've tried and failed with are to uninstall and reinstall Zoom (This didn't include use of the CleanZoom tool so that is the next step when the problem occurs)

To clean out Windows cache files entirely

2021-02-19 00:43:24,Zoom Useful Suggestions,"Just a few things that would be very useful for someone who Hosts a Zoom meeting for large groups multiple times a week.  


Host Controls  
All Host Controls need to be centrally located and easily accessed maybe even a pop out control panel that contains ALL Host Controls...  
Host Controls need an easier function Control of Participants Mute Button and Lower All Hands / Clear all Feedback.   It is far too easy to accidentally un mute / mute the wrong person because names and camera's shift when Feedback is activated or deactivated and the ""Lower All Hands"" function has been replaced with ""Clear All Feedback""  Which is located in the most out of reach place it could possibly be for a host...  
An ability to be able to lock participants camera locations.  
Host / Co Host ability to communicate with people in the waiting room that is clearly seen or heard by those in the waiting room or the ability to instantly move anyone in the waiting room into a private breakout room.

Host Control over what the participants see: Instead of allowing the participants to choose between speaker view and gallery view the host should have control over that.  The ability to force everyone into Speaker View would be very useful especially in a teaching environment.

Host ability to split screen or picture in picture the Spotlight Camera + Video or Picture being shared  
Host ability to dual, triple and quad spotlight function would be very useful.     
Option that lets Host assign participants to the desired spotlight location such as:   
Assign Participant to Spotlight 1  |  Assign Participant to Spotlight 2   
Pinning a camera should NOT remove the spotlight from someone...

Host Control of Participants

The host should have more control over what the participants can and can't do.  Such as:  


* Not allowing participants to use Virtual Backgrounds.    

* Choosing which feedback is allowed such as only allowing ""Raise Hand"".  Maybe giving the host a check box to choose which ones are allowed.  


Share Screen

It would be really nice to have a similar function of Sharing Videos added for Sharing Pictures.  
A built in share pictures or built in slide show share screen would be fantastic.  Mimicking the current Share Video function for sharing pictures would make things far easier, less troublesome and less clutter on the screen for the person sharing.

That's my first post on reddit; hope I dont miss out on any (unwritten) rules and that this group is actually the right one. 

I'm having struggles using the zoom app on iPad in a way that I seemingly cant regulate my volume which, especially combined with headphones sometimes leads to unusability. 

When I lower the iPad volume alone the Zoom Volume doesn't change. 

Couldn't find something to that problem in the internet. Maybe someone around here knows the problem and ideally also a solution.

I noticed on my phone that when someone joins, it says, ""blah blah joined"".  So I'm assuming there's something like that on the desktop version.  

&amp;nbsp;

I just feel it is annoying for a student to get disconnected and I can't figure out who it is in real-time.  

I'd think the ideal way is to have it like those Chats, where inside the chat, it'll say ""XX joined"" or ""XX Left""  .  But I'd also settle with a quick pop up at the top of the screen saying ""XX Joined/left"".

When I am the co-host I can record the meeting to my computer with no problem as long as the host is not recording to their cloud. However, as soon as the host presses ""record to cloud"" on their computer, my recording is surrounded by a cloud. Once the meeting ends, I cannot find this recording on my cloud recordings even days after the meeting and never receive a message about this recording being converted. The host has their recording, however, thankfully.

just a note: i tried reinstalling the client, it solved the problem temporarily. 2 weeks after that, it started doing its thing again. and calling via browser somehow freezes the system as well. i have absolutely no idea why.

When a user leaves a webinar, I want to have a survey at the end asking people for their feedback on the webinar session they have just had. I have made a short two-question survey in one webinar but now I need to find a way to copy it to any other webinars I make.

Is there a way to do this? I have tried using a webinar template and while this does seem to copy polls, it doesn't seem to copy surveys.

I have also seen that you can use a 3rd Party Survey but I think the issue is still going to be that we would essentially need to create different surveys for each session which 1. Is likely to come at an additional cost and 2. We would still have to copy the right link for each session.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Now I'm able to easily screen share my iPad screen to my computer screen, and from there, use the zoom application to screen share my screen share of what is present on my iPad (recursion here people kinda f'ed up sorry). I currently use Reflector Teacher as the application to share my Ipad screen to my computer and further to the zoom room participant. 

\*ADDITIONALLY, I AM ABLE to share my computer screen and have students take remote access of my computer desktop games (in ZOOM) via use of their own mouse movement and clicking/selecting actions within most of these applications running on MY COMPUTER.

Question: Is there an application or device that allows me to recursively screen share my Ipad to my computer, and from there, share my computer screen and application to the ""student"" or recipient on Zoom, where they CAN ACTUALLY TAKE CONTROL AND INTERACT WITH THE APPLICATION ON THE IPAD? I hope that made sense. Basically, I want to be able to share both my desktop computer activities/games AND my applications from my iPad, both to be utilized as a resource for speech therapy.

I’m an educator, and I’m really sick of using the annotation tool with my touchpad on my MacBook Pro to mark up my students documents, so when one of my colleagues told me I could screen share my iPad, I was excited to be able to use the pencil to mark it up!

However, MOST of the time, my iPad just says “unable to connect to [macbook pro]” when I do screen share&gt;share over airplay and then select my zoom room from screen mirroring on my iPad.

Everything I’ve found says that I need to make sure that ports are open on my router for this to work. So, I went into my router and opened all the ports they said to. I’m not an expert on this, and I’ve tried to use the IP address for my iPad, my computer, and my router in the settings, but nothing seems to work

EXCEPT that sometimes it does work! It usually works for a few minutes after a restart, or after I’ve made a change in my firewall settings on my router, but then when I go back to use it for my actual class, I encounter the same issue

I'm almost certain it's not my microphone or audio box because both of those work totally fine when recording via adobe audition (or any other thing I've used them with).

Is this a side-effect of the sandboxing? The applications setting for zoommtg type is set to 'always ask', which is what used to happen because I'd never got around to pointing it at the .deb's binary.

**How can I get it back or do I need to go back to the .deb?** Annoyingly, not everyone gives the meeting number and passcode.

When I share my iPad screen from my 13 inch Macbook Pro, I almost never experience any problems, regardless of the connection between the computer and the iPad.

However, when I share my iPad screen from my 16 inch MacBook Pro (which of course has significantly better specs), the iPad screen as viewed by participants will freeze after a few minutes of use.  The screen does not freeze for me on the iPad or on the computer.  This happens most often when I have a wired connection between the iPad and the 16"" MacBook Pro.

I am using Mojave on the 13"" and Big Sur on the 16"".

I at first thought that this was a software problem, but then noticed that the 16"" MacBook Pro was having some other hardware issues with charging and battery and began to suspect that this was actually a hardware issue.  Had it sent to apple and they found problems with the battery, but no evidence of problems with anything else.

I'd like to be able to use my 16"" MacBook again.  What is the most likely cause of this problem and what do I need to do to resolve it?

Both routes gave me nothing.

Has anybody experienced an issue where their computer locks up or crashes when their camera is turned on?

I have a PC with a Logitech C920 web cam and Zoom works fine when I keep my camera off.

When I turn it on, anywhere from 1 - 10 minutes my computer will either freeze, requiring a reboot, or it will go into a BSOD and reboot on its own. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tested the cam on another computer and it works fine.

I have tested the cam on my computer with other software (OBS) and that works fine.

The consistency is Zoom and the web cam.

I'm currently assisting with production of a virtual play that will be performed within a Zoom meeting. We're currently running into a small issue where when multiple people talk at the same time, Zoom seemingly starts randomly cutting off the audio of each one. Unfortunately, there are times in the play where having multiple people talk over each other is necessary.

Would this be resolved by having people turn on Original Sound from their microphones? The actors are all performing in front of a laptop with a speaker, so we wouldn't be able to have them disable echo cancellation entirely.

However, around December I realized I no longer wanted the premium plan and decided to downgrade to basic. I paid off what I thought was my last payment installment manually and cancelled the plan. However, I kept getting emails from Zoom telling me that I had a payment past due, and that I needed to pay it. I ended up having to call my bank, and they filed a claim disputing the payment. It turned out that whoever was in charge of the payments had failed to process my previous payment, and that I still had an outstanding balance of $16.06 and needed to pay that. My bank ended up adding credit to my account, and a few days later Zoom somehow found out my new debit card number and took their $16.06 (probably provided to them by the bank? I thought it was strange since I never updated my information but I didn't think too much of it since the bank had been in contact with them, etc.). I downgraded to basic and thought nothing of it. This all happened in January.

Today, 2/26, I received a notice from my online banking account stating that my card was being charged $16.06 from Zoom Communications, and that it was being declined for insufficient funds. I checked my account, and it is still on the Basic plan. The last invoice that I have listed on the account is from December. 

I don't know what I am being charged for, and because I am a Basic user the only support I get from Zoom is their automated bot that they have enabled on their website to answer basic questions.

2021-03-03 00:41:06,Others can't hear me if other participants make any noise,"During Zoom calls, other participants' noise always 'wins' from mine. That is to say, if anyone else starts talking while I'm talking, I will get cut out. If people are talking, I can never get a word in. If someone has even mild background noise, no one will hear me. This is quite annoying, because I have to teach online (and my students have definitely been taking advantage). My current solution is to wave so that people all mute themselves when I have something to say, but it is very frustrating. Some extra information:

\- It is not just Zoom, but also Google Meet and Microsoft Teams, leading me to believe it might be my computer. But it might be that I have certain settings in all of these programs. Hence posting it on this subreddit.

\- I have a MacBook Pro, using Mojave

\- The problem also occurs when I'm using headphones, so it's probably not Zoom filtering out noise made by my computer and filtering me as well by accident (unless it does that by knowing what noise Zoom is making rather than what the mic picks up, but I don't know how this works)

\- I have switched off background noise reduction in my Mac settings, to no avail

\- If I shout really loudly, I tend to get through, but that's not a great solution

2021-03-03 02:03:10,Zoom Alternative,"Zoom has become the norm over this past year and a Band-Aid for our shift to virtual, but it is not the right solution for all gatherings. If you’re Zoomed out like the rest of us, we’re here to say you can now say goodbye to Zoom! Virtual Venue is a Zoom alternative to replace your generic meetings with your own customized video gatherings right in your website. Do you need a Zoom account to use Virtual Venue? The answer is no. With Mixily you can start hosting video connections, without Zoom. 

*I can’t find the link to the meeting! Can you resend the music playlist? I hate Zoom!* 

How many times have you said or heard these recently? 

Zoom is way more complicated than is needed for most meetings and events. Settings are buried, the links are random and someone always can’t figure out how to join last minute. It’s clunky, outdated and a pain. Generic Zoom meetings are so 2020. If you’re looking to refresh your digital gatherings, Virtual Venue could be just what you’re looking for.

2021-03-04 04:25:04,Set Audio Latency in Zoom,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I am using Zoom to host a live streamed class for my business. I'm using OBS Studio to control my three video sources. The audio (in and out) is currently being handled in Zoom through a logitech conference phone system. My problem is that one of my cameras (GoPro Hero Black 7) has a little latency to it, perhaps around 750ms. Through OBS I can slow the other two cameras but the audio will then not line up with all three cameras.

Is there a way to add latency to audio through Zoom or will I have to find another way around this problem?

(I run the audio through Zoom as getting OBS and Zoom to talk has been extremely difficult. I was able to get the video working through trial and error but audio has been a thorn in my side.)",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/Zoom/comments/lx3g7v/set_audio_latency_in_zoom/,emeril91

I'm a teacher that needs help! I am hoping to show a movie to my hybrid (about half of my students are in person and half are at home) class next week for a film study. It's *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* on Netflix. However, I just realized that when you try and share your screen while streaming Netflix, it shows a black screen. 

Any ideas for what I can do? I am a little worried since I have already sent permission slips and the kids are excited. I show videos on YouTube all the time, so it did not occur to me that this would be an issue.

2. If a user had removed the Zoom desktop shortcut, it was put back on the desktop.

Essentially, it creates a ""virtual camera"" that you can select while on Zoom.  Then in the Xsplit app, you simply choose a virtual background and/or blur your background.  My gen3 i5 is able to handle these features while in a zoom conference, so I'm hoping that this helps others.  

I'm sure that I'm not the only one still rocking an older computer.  I have no reason to upgrade yet, since the computer does everything I need it to do with no issues.  I generally don't like virtual backgrounds, but it can be a helpful tool when my SO and I are sharing the home office.

It was telling me I was connected by microphone and speaker, but I couldn't hear anyone and no one could hear me, no matter what I did (switching back between my webcam audio, computer audio, earbuds, etc., nothing worked).

2021-03-10 02:13:30,Is there a time limit for Zoom Meeting Waiting Room OR Attendee on Hold features?,"If I'm hosting a Zoom Meeting and I put an attendee in the Waiting Room OR on hold, is there a time limit for how long that person can stay in the Waiting Room OR on hold? 

I routinely host 90-minute senior leadership meetings that often feature guest speakers for select agenda items during the middle of the meeting. For example, the meeting officially starts at 10:00 AM and there may be guest speakers scheduled to brief the senior leadership at 10:45 AM. I will tell the guest speakers that their agenda item is scheduled for 10:45 AM, however they are welcome to join with everyone else at 10:00 AM and I'll place them on hold or in the waiting room until we get to their agenda item. 

Assuming they join at 10:00 AM, the guest speakers would be on hold/in the waiting room for 45 minutes. 

Every so often, the previous agenda item runs longer than scheduled and--in this example--we might not be ready for the guest speakers until closer to 11:00 AM. In this event, the guest speakers could end up on hold/in the waiting room for an hour (or slightly longer). This is obviously not ideal and I try to avoid having anyone wait for longer than 15 - 20 minutes, but sometimes it can't be helped! 

So to my question: Does there ever come a time when Zoom will disconnect someone from a Waiting Room OR from being on hold because they've been waiting too long? I can't find anything in the Zoom Help Center or elsewhere online that mentions a time limit for either feature, but I assume Zoom figures no one would ever be in a waiting room or on hold for more than a few minutes so there's no need for them to advertise any time limits (which I'm sure DO exist).

FYI: I have a Zoom for Gov Pro license. My agency just switched from Webex Meetings and I used the waiting room feature all the time for the same senior leadership meeting, and there was one instance in which a guest speaker was disconnected from the meeting because they'd been waiting for 60 minutes.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/m1chpk/is_there_a_time_limit_for_zoom_meeting_waiting/,JerriBlankStare

So long story short, me and my coworkers in my department were invited to a meeting over Zoom, where a client wanted to thank us for some work we've done for them recently. I received the link at around 11 this morning, and I'd not had to do any meetings over Zoom while working from home, so I wanted to make sure I was all set up. I had the app downloaded on my computer already, and clicked the link that I was supplied. I assumed that since I was early, the meeting wouldn't be started and would need to be started by whoever was hosting it. However, when I successfully joined, I saw there were a couple people's faces visible via webcam along the top of the screen.

Instantly, I panicked because I thought maybe they could see/hear me. I was faced with a couple pop-ups, which I only vaguely read because I was desperately trying to exit out of the meeting, but I think it was requesting me to join using computer audio, and after closing that pop-up, saw one that I think read ""proceed without using computer audio?"", which I said yes to, and quickly closed Zoom. During this whole fiasco, I couldn't hear them speaking at all, and the place where my face would appear along the top if my webcam were on, said ""connecting..."" or something.

The reason I'm so concerned is because while I work, especially from home, I like to listen to podcasts in the background. Well, since I wasn't aware there were actually going to be people waiting in the zoom call when I decided to test the link...I still had my podcast playing. and let's just say, the topic being discussed wasn't exactly something you'd deem safe for work...

I checked my audio settings in Zoom after the fact, and the options that were UN-checked (disabled) were:

\- Automatically join audio by computer when joining a meeting

\- Mute my microphone when joining a meeting

The other two options (hold space to unmute, and sync buttons to headset) were enabled.

Please tell me my coworkers/clients didn't potentially hear some shit...lol",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/m1di1g/trying_to_determine_whether_or_not_the_people/,nmad95

I am a poor person, and I use comcast for my internet, and I was wondering what ways I could use to limit the bandwith used.

By this I mean, I want to limit the data usage by zoom (per second).This is because of the fact that my ISP limits my total data usage, and zoom does not have any incoming video quality control. I always keep my own video + audio disabled. Also, when the meeting host or anyone else screenshares, it automatically streams it at 1080p, using up a lot of my data.

So far I have tried:

Using the web version of Zoom instead of the app and disabling javascript/images/other things.

I hide all non video participants as well as Disable Video Receiving.  Is there a way I can somehow limit this usage?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/m1jk7t/limiting_the_bandwidth_zoom_uses/,doctormane

Is there a way to record automatically the video when the course starts, without my computer being on etc?

2021-03-11 18:32:05,Editing Contact Names,"I'm running an English as second language meetup group over Zoom, and due to the 40 minute time limit, I'm usually sending out a link to the next one during the meeting. Sometimes myself or the participant forgets to copy it and I have to chase them up by emailing it or messaging elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've started adding the regular attendees to my contacts list so I can directly invite them to make it easier in case of such an occurrence. That brings me to the problem: many of those attendees have no profile picture, and have their accounts set up with their real names (Chinese names, Korean names etc). For my most frequent attendees, that's not a problem as I know them well, but as my contact list gets bigger with older members and people who only come occasionally, it makes it difficult to quickly and accurately identify who I want to invite from the list.

2021-03-11 23:16:27,Why Can't I Join a Meeting Through the Zoom Client (and sometimes browser)?,"First off, my university is using Zoom and I was given an account with locked settings. Secondly, my problem has started about 2 weeks ago, but then it was sporadic. Sometimes when it was way after my class was supposed to start that in the client it said that the meeting has not joined but then I found a workaround accidentally while trying to join, which was to just join from browser/re-sign in. Now, this is getting on my nerves alot. I try and join any meeting, even when it was supposed to start 10 minutes ago and I still get the ""meeting has not started"" thing. I try and join from a browser and it doesn't work aswell! I try and re-sign in and it also doesn't work. I try and rejoin the meeting over and over again from the client and the browser and so far, through a week of observations, the client is just broken, it just doesn't want to join any meetings while the browser is 50/50. This is nerve wrecking for me since I can get late to classes and this inconsistency makes me question whether what I am doing works at all. I reinstalled Zoom like twice and have restarted multiple times but it doesn't work. I am super confused as to why since I literally did not download anything in like a month. This is very weird and it hinders my ability to do things properly, especially since the browser versions is very inflexible for me as compared to the client. Thank you very much for help.

I am a host of a meeting, and have set up breakout rooms. 

I have assigned several co-hosts, who, according to everything I could find online, should be able to move participants between breakout rooms.  

And indeed, most of them can.  Great.  But there were a few who could not.  

1. They properly had co-host label next to their name
2. They had other co-host functions, such as recording, mute/unmute, ask to start vid, etc. which all worked fine
3. One was on a Chromebook, which may have been the issue, but the other was on a Windows 10 PC.  

If I can provide any more details please let me know!   I'd love to get this figured out asap.  Thanks again everyone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/m32ygg/some_cohosts_cannot_move_participants_between/,ooOJuicyOoo
2021-03-12 06:49:30,Why isn't the audio recording completely?,"Say I have 8 people on a meeting and I've chosen to have each caller's audio recorded into a separate file.

The whole call was 60 minutes long, but the audio files are only 15 minutes long at the longest and one is only 5 minutes long. Why is this and how can I get it to record all 60 minutes of audio? Most of the audio is going to be silence since people are muted most of the time. Yes, this will make for bigger audio tracks, but that's fine.

The reason this matters is when I go to edit the video, I want the audio to sync up with the video. Person A says, ""that's great, thank you at marker 00:57:47 in the video, but the audio file for Person A says they said this at at 00:14:09. I would have to spend a lot of time hunting and pecking to find exactly who said what where and get it to sync up with the video.

What I *really* would love to see is a separate (real-time) audio track of everyone BUT the host (I record myself separately on OBS). Yes, I can combine all the audio tracks into one file via Audacity, but that would be one less step. But first I need audio I can sync with video.

2021-03-12 18:19:57,Removing a timestamp from an already-recorded video,"Hi all, 

I think I already know the answer to this, unfortunately, but on the off chance there's a solution I thought I'd ask. 

I had the timestamp box ticked when I did an interview on Zoom yesterday. I thought this was produce a metadata file that I could use for reference when editing and allow me to toggle the timestamp on and off. Apparently not. It's baked-in. 

I want to remove the timestamp. I only have a local (rather than cloud) recording (why it didn't record to the cloud too I don't know - it should have). 

I have the MP4 file plus the .zoom files (called 'double\_click\_to\_convert' - three of them, I assume for the three participants in the meeting). 

I also have a .tag, .tmp and .m3u files. I don't know what these ones are for. 

I'm hoping some of these files might hold the secret. 

Lesson learnt for future attempts, but for this one does anyone know of a solution?

I'm hosting a conference tomorrow which is going to be about 5 hours long. I'm wanting to record it to the cloud, but I'm pretty confident that it will take up way more than the 1GB that I have on my Pro plan.  


I was looking at the option to buy a cloud recording add on. I can buy 100GB of storage for the month for £32 which would be more than enough. But I also notice that with the cloud recording add on, there are fees for excess use (£1.20 per GB for the 100GB plan to £0.08 per GB for the 3TB plan).  


It seems to me that it may well be cheaper to just do without an add on and pay the excess fee for however many GB I go over for the month.  


So, I suppose my two questions are: 1) If I have a pro plan and no cloud recording add on, what happens if I go over the cloud storage limit? Will my recordings still be accessible or will they not save?  


2) If it's just a matter of paying an excess fee, how much is it per GB when I don't have a cloud recording add on? I can't see the answer to either question anywhere on the Zoom site or on Google for that matter.

So I was having an important art lesson in my class, and then we ended our reunion, but then I realized that for some reason THE APP DID NOT SAVE THE LOCAL RECORDING AT ALL.

Is there any way to restore it at this point? I'm not having another meeting, it was the last one, but I really, urgently need it back. Please. PLEASE. IS THERE A WAY?

If there's no way, it doesn't matter... There are some things I still know of the recording, like the details and some screenshots, but the important one is the subtitles... I really need it. NEED IT. Sorry if I'm overreacting, but I want to be good at art, and I'm slow at processing some things, so I'm not always up-to-date on certain things.

2021-03-15 01:41:54,"the zoom web applet cannot correctly manage multiple cameras, and thats just pathetic","THE GEAR: a laptop with multiple cameras; 3d real sense, forward facing, rear facing, and lets throw in virtual drivers just to cover all the bases. 

THE SETUP: upon enabling video, zoom web version defaults to 3d camera upon every launch, regardless of history, regardless of browser permission, regardless of endpoint sec permission, regardless of the driver for these multiple cameras even being enabled (not sure how thats even possible) 

THE PROBLEM #1: the 3d camera that zoom defaults to isnt a usable camera for the purpose of video conference, its a 3d camera for applications that sense depth

THE PROBLEM #2: zoom web applet cannot and will not change between camera types once the default has been initialized, the error message reason something like ""blah blah camera is being used by another application"" but its not - its just fkin not. how do i know its not? because my endpoint sec reports any access to the webcam as does windows 10 as does my damn browser, so no zoom the camera isnt activated elsewhere, your applet is just busted. 

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS I HAVE TRIED:

\-clear browser cache  
\-reset browser webcam access permissions  
\-reset endpoint sec webcam access permissions  
\-reset meeting settings for host and client  
\-tried all the above on TWO other browsers  
\-disabled drivers for every camera except the one i wanted to use  
\-tried offboard usb camera  


Listen, pure honestly time, I don't like Zoom, its think its crap compared to the alternatives, I know its a security risk, I know its a privacy nightmare, and I know its desktop application (which I wouldn't use if you paid me) is malware incarnate, BUT zoom is also popular (for reasons beyond understanding) and sometimes I have to bite the bullet and be the one guy who changes because asking several others to migrate to a superior platform is just not prudent. 

If anyone knows the fix for this you get upvotes for days. Also perfectly willing to upvote unhelpful condescending comments from people who think I'm crazy for hating zoom even though, heh well lets just face it, I'm fully justified. THANKS!

For example, if you miss any of the webinars, you'll get a ""sorry we missed you"" email.  If you attend more than one in the series, you'll get as many ""thank you"" emails as you attended.

That's dumb. It shouldn't be too difficult for Zoom to figure out if someone attended at least one or none of the recurring webinars.

It is an intermittent problem where after a few seconds the video image freezes and the program hangs.  I can still hear and talk, but my image is frozen and I can't click anything.  Unplugging my USB webcam and plugging it back in sometimes fixes this problem for a few minutes and then it happens again.  Sometimes it just causes the software to crash and I have to re-log on. Sometimes instead of freezing I just get a solid orange screen instead of my video.  Again, unplugging the usb webcam and plugging it back in sometimes fixes it, sometimes not.  Sometimes if I plug it into a different USB port it seems to help..   sometimes not.  


 I am using a fully updated version of Windows 10,  and a USB webcam.  The PC is a current and quite high end (we like to play computer games when we aren't working hehe).

2021-03-30 00:33:33,[Sharing computer Audio] Music teacher looking for way to share WASAPI/ASIO driver's (DAW output) audio.,"Hi!

With the whole Coronavirus situation most music teachers have resorted to giving online lessons. As a singing teacher I'm a little uncomfortable with this - it's unprecedented for me. Tried giving some purely vocal lessons, but the technology (microphones, latency, bandwidth, and student's experience with technology) are often in the way. Seldom do I feel like I could really have a student walk away from the session with something tangible, as they often do in face-to-face lessons.

Therefore I've tried to get students going with some creative production / home recording on BandLab, as well as with Cakewalk for the more advanced / older students. However I ran into a problem... I'd like to have them hear my computer audio, but Zoom won't pick up on the audio of my DAW, Cakewalk (or an online web-based DAW called BandLab), running in either WASAPI Shared or ASIO mode.

I've had good luck with our setup on other apps, like Teams, but on Zoom, the audio is horribly suppressed. People have to turn their volume up all the way to even just barely hear anyone in our conference room. The input levels are also turned all the way up.

It doesn't matter what mics we're using. I used some old microphones that we used to hang from the ceiling in there, and also brand-new wireless mics that were installed with the rest of the setup. They all have the same result. Passable in Teams and other apps, but near-impossible to hear on Zoom.

I've tried several of the options in Zoom's settings. I suspect it's one of the auto-leveling options that Zoom likes to keep under the hood but if anyone has any ideas on what else I can try, I'm all ears.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/mgkbjo/horrible_audio_suppression_problems/,SmaMan788
