We held a meeting via Zoom and it was not a paid subscription. We want the list of participants but learnt now that only paid subscribers can obtain a list of participants. 

So the question is-even if we upgrade our subscription to paid, will we be able to get a list of participants for the past meeting which has already happened when we were using the free version? Thx",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/nujwvo/list_of_participants/,codebeanjava8

2021-06-08 05:31:00,Control Pulpit Mic Mute/Unmute remotely?,"We have been having Zoom-only church services for over 14 months. But we recently turned to in-person and Zoom HYBRID services. In our services, there are many different, individual participants, both local and online. However, we have learned very well how to manage the Mute/Unmute process for online participants, we are very, very happy with that. But, in our 'local' (In-Person) participants, we have a few microphones (we use old, or in-service, iPhones and Androids) where we log in to Zoom with video-only or audio-only.

We are actually doing wonderful with our array of cameras, but we are NOT comfortable with how our phones used as Mics are Muted/Unmuted. Our pulpit phone, for instance, is used by 4 people on a Sunday and some do and some do not need to unmute. These are not the same people, and we realize people are trainable, but we want our services to go absolutely seamlessly.  So, ...

It would be a great help if there was a way for our host (and Co-Hosts) to manage the mute and unmute functions from our control panel. The same as other Zoom users over the Covid days, we really enjoyed the pre-Covid defaults!

2021-06-09 22:22:26,I soft-locked myself from deleting my Zoom account. How do I fix this?,"I made a Zoom account by selecting sign-in with google and selecting my school email since I didn't want to use my personal email. I'm starting to regret it.

Now that I'm done with the school year, I want to delete my Zoom account. But in order to do that, I need to submit a verification code that they send to my email that I used to sign up with. I can't do that because the student email I used is managed by my school and doesn't allow emails outside of school to be received. Meaning that all the Zoom support emails don't even show up, not in spam or trash or in all mail, it simply isn't there.

I've tried contacting my school to see if they could just allow the no-reply@Zoom email to be allowed, but they're not willing to do that. 

I've tried to change the email to my personal one so I could receive the support emails, but it requires the password for my account to do so, which I have forgotten.

I've tried to change the password for my account, but it just sends the email to my school email which doesn't even show up as stated above.

The only way I could ever see this being solved is if I could just have someone at Zoom to either manually delete my account, or to email my personal email with the password so that I could at least delete it myself. However, I doubt that would happen. Does anyone have any suggestions to what I should do?

Other information: 

* I don't have the Zoom app, I just use the online web version. 
* My account is a basic one, I should be able to delete my account without providing a code according to the Zoom support page for terminating an account.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/Zoom/comments/nvx4dg/i_softlocked_myself_from_deleting_my_zoom_account/,Throwaway_1437

2021-06-14 07:30:11,App to let you search by keyword in messages,"As a person who often joins Zoom rooms with large numbers of participants, following multiple chat conversations at once can get difficult. Zoom makes it easy to read and search through chat history of past meetings, but nothing for a meeting you're currently in.

What would be amazing to find is something that enables chat filters that would allow you to display things like only your private messages, only messages from a specified user, etc. but I also realized that even something incredibly bare-bones that simply exports your chat messages into a text-editor or something live as they come in could provide that functionality in a way, allowing you to just Ctrl/Cmd-F what you're looking for within that document. Obviously something like this may not be fully effective when, for example, a user renames themself, unless it's programmed to go back and retroactively replace that user's name in previous messages, but that would be a negligible issue most of the time.

However, even if there is a program that is only able to search through the content of the messages itself and not the user or private/public status, I would still be interested in that as well. Really, I'm just hoping to find anything that makes Zoom's chat easier to navigate. If there really is nothing out there then I will learn to code just to build that bare-bones program myself lmao.",1.0,7.0,0.9,6.0,/r/Zoom/comments/nz90ev/app_to_let_you_search_by_keyword_in_messages/,hazpex
2021-06-14 08:30:03,[Question] How do I incorporate two additional camera feeds into my Zoom meetings?,"I have three cameras I need to incorporate into my Zoom meetings in addition to those of attendees.  How do I do that?
---

Details:
1) My main camera is a Sony RX100 III.  This focused on me.
2) A Logitech c920 will focus on scorecards that I flip by hand.
3) A cheap Versa Cam (1080 full HD) will focus on essentially a placeholder to force a four-box configuration on the screen.  Not that it matters, but it focuses on just a card with the show's logo on it.  This feed is only seen by me, the contestants, and my editor ... though when I do live YouTube streams, it will seen by those who are watching the live streams.

If you're wondering what I'm am trying to do, here's a link to playlist of the first competition series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0IpxJ6_Xd0&amp;list=PL7mHjDLBCmOpCMUZ2DmyFEgJHFxY-N4_O

For the above videos, I used the c920 for my main camera (the one on me) and then two smartphones that I invite to the meetings.  I set them up without sound with one focusing on the scorecards (lower right box) and the other on a placeholder image (lower left box) to force a four-box configuration.  Now you don't see what the placeholder sees in the above linked videos as my editor superimposes the show's logo over its feed and changes that to images related to what the contestants are asking or thinking out loud.

It is a PAIN to have to set up the two cellphones to do this and thus why I got the two new cameras BUT what I don't know is how to get Zoom to accept their feeds.  The tech guy at the camera shop hadn't a clue except for suggesting I somehow use another software program but nothing beyond that and no real instruction on how to actually do even that.",1.0,1.0,1.0,40.0,/r/Zoom/comments/nza6wx/question_how_do_i_incorporate_two_additional/,Jack_T_Decker

I'll go into his main need in case there's a other solution.. he wants to sing with the help of background music in a zoom call. 

Options
1. Play the background music on one device and keep it close to the second device with zoom... Poor voice quality but works.
2. All audio is on one device share the audio via zoom -- use the mic for singing and play the background music in another app on the same device.

2021-06-15 23:09:32,Standalone Zoom Rooms license and external access,"Hi all,

I work at a university institute and we have a conference space where we would like to install a Zoom Rooms setup in order to make hybrid events easier. However, the IT department of the university does not have any Zoom Rooms license to share and governance is not willing to allocate an annual budget for this. However, since our institute is self-funded, we are willing to cover the costs. Here are my questions, for which I haven't been able to find answers on Zoom official FAQ nor elsewhere :

1. Is it possible to buy a standalone Zoom Rooms license (i.e. not attached to our university account, for which I have no admin access)? Do I need to have a Pro account in order to configure/use a Zoom Room?
2. Most users of this Zoom Room will use their university Zoom account, while some others will connect with different Enterprise or personal accounts. Can anyone connect to a Zoom Room if they have the code or are in proximity, regardless of the type of account and organization?

Thank you for any help =)",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/Zoom/comments/o0gl3e/standalone_zoom_rooms_license_and_external_access/,MyUsernameWasLame

Is there anyway we can make the breakout rooms sync across the host/co-hosts, so that we are seeing the same thing?

2021-06-16 13:41:43,Zoom Pro License Clarification,"Hi. This is probably asked a lot but I'm not sure how to dig it up. Just want to clarify, is it possible to freely share just 1 license key to another user I've added into my account and then take it back anytime?

We belong to an organization but they are unfamiliar with how to set up a Pro key. I have access to payment to get a Pro key. Is it possible to temporarily be able to give my Pro license to another user (organization account) at will so they can set up their own meetings without me having to be present and then move it back to me for my own use when done? Or would I need 2 licenses in total - one permanently stuck to me, another to be able to move freely among my registered users?

Essentially my account will act as the account holder of the license because I have the payment means. Unless there is a way to gift a pro license key with me just paying it?

TL;DR can I move 1 pro license freely among my registered users or do I always need 2 with 1 permanently with my account and the other freely moving among my users?

My Account (Pro)
Organization (Basic)
-&gt; 
My Account (Basic)
Organization (Pro)

Note: I understand they can just give me the organization account itself and set up a different password but I am protecting my payment details.

2021-06-16 20:59:18,Conducting a webinar from a Zoom Room,"We have a Zoom Room running Polycom x50 Studio.  We frequently conduct public meetings where there are board members around the table which we want shown to the public and on occasion Attendees of the webinar can be then made allowed to speak.

We stuck with Webinars because for the most part there is no participation and we could have a few members of the public or up to hundreds viewing.

My question is around the limitations of the Zoom Room software on the Polycom control tablet.  It doesn't allow us to easily start the webinar up as host. I wind up having to join the webinar as the room, then promote the room to panelist, then mute my laptop and unmute the room so we don't have a feedback loop.

I've also tried making the room the host but that gets clunky because the participant control is not great on that tablet software.  Suggestions for making this smoother?

I haven't connected to zoom since last wednesday when it worked perfectly. Today I opened it after a week to connect, but it keeps giving me ""Untrusted Server Certificate"".  I have done nothing and changed nothing in settings. Especially not the certificate, because I don't know how. I am a simple user, not a power user, so I dont know these settings.  


Google search gave me a possibility in network changes or proxy connection, but I haven't changed any network settings for years now, and I am not on proxy connection, because I don't have a desktop VPN. The only time I use vpn, I use it from browser. Firewall has zoom allowed.   


Basically there has been no changes at all, from last wednesday to today, in the PC or in zoom settings, but I can't connect now due to ""Untrusted Server Certificate""

2021-06-18 11:24:13,"Converted meeting recording is incomplete, but Zoom never stopped recording?","Okay so this is bugging me A LOT. Yes, this is a Licensed Zoom account.

About midway through the meeting, I received a pop-up notification that said I was logged out of the account because someone else was using it (a few people have access to the account and sometimes, they forget to log out so Zoom automatically logs them into the last known account). 

I didn't get kicked out of the meeting room nor did the ""Recording"" indicator on the upper left pause or stop, but Zoom did give me the regular pop-up for converting a meeting recording. Not thinking much of it, I let it convert, thinking it had detected an unconverted meeting recording from yesterday.

But lo and behold when the event finally ended, I didn't receive the usual ""Convert Meeting"" prompt, and was instead met with a recording that ended right about the same time I received the ""logged out of the account"" notification.

Thing is, I literally have proof that Zoom told me the meeting was still recording. We took a group photo at the end and I'm looking at it right now. I shit you not, it says ""Recording..."" on the upper left. It did not pause, nor did it stop.

So where did the rest of the recording go? How can I recover it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/o2ffw2/converted_meeting_recording_is_incomplete_but/,911ThatCrazedFangirl

When I did, I changed the host back to her but, somehow my account was the one recording. The problem is that my account is just a basic account. And when the class ended, I just realised that I had been recording, then I stopped the recording and it said that it's a cloud recording etc etc. I waited for the email but none appeared, I checked everywhere for the recorded meeting but it's not available. So currently, I would like to know if I can only access the cloud recording if I upgrade my account to paid subscription or it's actually already lost since my account is just basic? Or if the link would be accessible to the host which is my lecturer? She still hasn't received it yet. So now I don't know what's the step to rectify this. It's a very important recording due to the fact that it's our only class for the subject. Thank you so much for anyone who contributes.

A coordinator will create a Zoom event from Google Calendar (integrated with their Zoom), assign me as the alternative host and then leave me to host the meeting on the day.

Is this because the meeting is tied to their Zoom account? I thought assigning me as an alternative host would mean that didn't happen but it's occurred several times.

One of the features of this audio drama is that it asks the audience to go to certain places in their space (a window, a door, etc.), so a browser based option is not ideal. 

We need:

* Something that is mobile friendly
* Something that does not require its audience members to download an app (Zoom's call-in feature is appealing)
* A way to play live sound effects and underscoring
* Decent audio quality

We would like:

* An option to livestream video as well

Currently our leading contender is zoom, but zoom's audio quality when you use the Share Sound feature (which would be the only way to play live sound effects and underscoring) is greatly reduced.

2021-06-24 22:29:05,Meeting time limit with licensed host not participating,"Hi there,

As we get ready for another hybrid school year, I'm trying to find some information about meeting time limits. In the first few days of the year, it is not uncommon for students not to have their school account yet (it usually takes up to a month for administrative enrollment). Besides that, in our program we often have guest lecturers who are not part of our staff (so they don't necessarily have a licensed account).

If the pedagogical coordinator (who is a licensed user) schedules a meeting but never joins, and the meeting participants are all basic (free) Zoom users, does the 40-minute time limit still apply? (Last year she joined for every meeting, but making sure the videoconference works is not part of her job as she has other stuff to do).

I make a new Zoom account every few months, IDK, I guess for general OPSEC purposes.  

I was logged into Zoom on my browser with the *new* account I had created yesterday, and was going through the settings, etc. At the time, I was logged into the new account on the desktop client.

I left my desk for a few minutes, and came back suddenly to find that my Zoom desktop client was now logged in but under my **OLD** account.  But i was in the new account in my browser still.

What kind of tomfoolery happened here?  Anyone have any guesses?  The only thing I can think of is that my VPN switched IP addresses while I was gone.  And I think this may be sort of a grey area with using a VPN and Zoom at the same time, etc, with their terms of service, but I digress.

I guess I could write a process that gets a list of users from group B, and while looping each one - gets all users from group B and assigns each of those as a scheduling assistant - but that seems kind of inefficient if there's a better way to achieve the intended result. I would also need to utilize 2 webhooks to run this check any time a user is added to either of the groups

\*Looking at the available webhooks it doesn't seem like there's an event for 'user joins a group' so the above described process would need to be a recurring job.

Today, I found the location folder of  the screenshots I take using the zoom's inbuilt screenshot tool. When  we use  Alt+Shift+T  a screenshot capture arrow pop-ups, and we usually  click ""Capture"" button, but we can't find where it is located (not in *C:\\Users\\Computer's name\\Documents\\Zoom*).

So  We all click the download button while taking a screenshot using zoom's  screenshot tool, which requires us to specify the location every time.

Today while trying something, I found that screenshots which I have not downloaded but clicked ""*CAPTURE*"" is located in **C:\\Users\\Computer's name\\AppData\\Roaming\\Zoom\\data\\**[**plx7n4-hto233k8ipfmtua@xmpp.zoom.us**](mailto:plx7n4-hto233k8ipfmtua@xmpp.zoom.us)**\\cf58f5bcf85578006d8135f361fb76f23b310e7be61cb35cc2eb76304cb24efd.**

Our IT department suggested everyone gets a 64-but version of zoom but that hasn’t helped much 

People have turned their screens off when sharing but that hasn’t helped much

Everyone has a brand new windows Dell laptop from the company so there shouldn’t be any old laptop issues

This method will help you join all your meetings, without wasting your time by **not** clicking ""Launch Meeting"" all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

* After you have clicked inspect, head over to ""console"" tab. 
* Next, after clicking the  ""console"" tab' now click on the blue ""launch Meeting"" button
* It will pop up saying ""Open URL: Zoom Launcher"". Click that for confirmation
* At the moment you click, the console tab will an underlined text like in the screenshot below.

* You have to click in the underlined text, and it will ultimately open a new tab
* Then in the new tab's URL box, copy the contained Text like in the screenshot below.

https://preview.redd.it/53w7nthlmz871.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93e19c5ce080b536f36ba967d5470a4f215b10a0

* Then, click ""Next"" and give your desired name to the shortcut like ""My Meeting"" and finally click ""Finish"".

**Now, guys, you have the shortcut for your Zoom meeting. Now what you have to do is to simply click on the shortcut to join the meeting every time, rather than clicking the link or typing the meeting ID &amp; Passcode.**

**This time, no browser will be opened, and you don't have to click** ***Launch meeting*** **all the time.**

*Note 1 : This Method is applicable to all chromium based browsers like chrome, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi, Opera Etc.*

*Note 2 : This method is applicable for only the meeting of that specific link. You have to repeat the steps if you want shortcuts for all your meetings.*

I hope you all now understood the steps &amp; can now join your meetings instantly.

2021-07-06 23:53:30,If you can't focus in your meetings like me...Doodling might be the answer!!,"**The science of doodles and daydreams**

In a study published in *Applied Cognitive Psychology*, participants listened to a 2.5-minute recording that invited them to a birthday party. 

In the recording, the speaker weaves in eight place names and eight other party attendees together as she rambles about a sick cat, her kitchen redecoration, and the weather.   


Half the participants were given a paper with squares and circles to shade in while they listened. The other half just listened and took notes. On average, the doodlers recalled 29 percent more information than the non-doodlers.  


The study’s author, Professor Jackie Andrade’s leading theory for why this happened is that you prevent daydreaming when you [doodle](https://www.hugo.team/blog/doodling-in-meetings), ""When your brain is supposedly doing nothing and daydreaming, it’s really doing a tremendous amount.""

So, while the popular narrative conflates doodling with daydreaming, the science suggests the former suppresses that activity, allowing the brain to engage in other functions.

**How to doodle during meetings without coming off rude**

The unfortunate reality is that scribbling abstract lines and shapes on paper is generally seen as a sign that you’re not paying attention.   


The only way to make sure that your team does not perceive you as rude is by communicating what you’re doing. Be explicit with your colleagues about why you’re doodling—to improve your concentration.   


But don’t just tell them you’re paying attention.   


Periodically look up from your doodles to make eye contact. Ask questions and offer feedback when asked. Make a point to reference topics they covered to show that you’ve been listening.  


It may be a good idea to engage more than you typically would while people adjust to your behavior. Even if they logically understand why you’re doodling, it may take time for them to get over their preconceived notions.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/oexqbu/if_you_cant_focus_in_your_meetings_like/,Odd-Bluebird2523

2021-07-12 02:01:12,How to Lead Zoom(Remote) Meetings with Focus &amp; Intention,"**Start with a Clear, Actionable Plan**

Before you turn on that webcam to launch a meeting, iron out the logistics. 

* What is the primary objective? 
* What information or materials will be covered? 
* What strategies need to be explored? 
* What are the problems to solve or decisions to rule on?

“Once you have a list of goals, it’s easy to plan your team meetings in more detail. Prepare an agenda in which you identify the main talking points and subjects you wish to discuss. If your team needs to make decisions, be sure you allocate enough time to get people familiar with the topic beforehand,” explains Hubgets in Improve Team Meetings for Better Collaboration and Productivity.

**Be Aware and Respectful of Time**

Looking at multiple faces on a screen for a long time can over-stimulate and fatigue the brain, making it hard to absorb the [meeting’s](https://www.hugo.team/blog/how-to-lead-remote-meetings) content, suggests *Harvard Business Review**.*

Ensure employees stay engaged and attentive by remaining conscious of how long the meeting runs. Start and finish on time, set an expectation for punctuality (hold yourself accountable to that as well), and keep the discussion on topic and concise. 

Don’t assume one hour is the time you need for every meeting, either. Experiment until you find a length that works for your team. Some companies even yield results with meetings as brief as 10 to 15 minutes, as business psychologist *Steven Rogelberg* revealed in his 2019 Ted Talk.

**Set the Tone for Communication**

How you interact with one another in a meeting is just as important as what you talk about, so be intentional in your verbal and nonverbal communication. Establish parameters such as asking each person to mute themselves unless they have the floor and keep everyone on track by saving all side conversations for another time. This will minimize interruptions and keep the dialogue constructive.  

You also want to ensure that your facial expressions, hand gestures, eye contact, and body posture reinforce the tone and meaning of your words. “Relaying information in real-time is not limited to verbal interchanges or the use of language. Nonverbal communication is extraordinarily powerful…If a person’s words fail to match their nonverbal cues, it’s best to trust the nonverbal messages,” says Jeff Wolf, executive business coach.

Body language can communicate all kinds of subtext that other people instinctively read, Wolf continues. Eye contact implies trust, understanding, and honesty. Vocal inflections, gestures, and facial expressions can either soften or accentuate a point. And an open, stable posture shows confidence, alertness, and receptivity. 

**Take Notes and Record the Video**

With your team scattered in various locations, balancing the demands of both work and home life, not everyone will be able to attend all the meetings scheduled. This is inevitable, but you can work it around it by taking notes and recording the discussion so those who were absent can access it later. 

Notes are much more practical here. But, even if, in practice, most people don’t watch the recording, knowing that it is available will put team members at ease about missing a discussion. Notes and recordings also make it easier for anyone on the team to refer back to this content if they have questions, need clarification, or forgot a relevant detail. ",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/oi9b61/how_to_lead_zoomremote_meetings_with_focus/,Odd-Bluebird2523

2021-07-12 03:27:59,Microphone levels become lower when turning original sound on,"I am wondering if anyone is experiencing issues when using original sound enabled or have a solution. When toggling original sound on and off my participants can hear a large drop off in volume when I set to on. I can also see the zoom microphone metering drop off from my side too when set to on. 

My setup is a microphone through a Focusrite 2i2 with an XLR mic on a Win 10 device.

I’ve never had gain or level issues in any other application before, nor am I experiencing any issues with other applications. 

I’ve confirmed microphone audio levels are in an acceptable -18 to -14db range through metering in a DAW. My Focusrite onboard light metering is also showing acceptable response. Windows microphone level is properly setup at 100% levels. I’ve also confirmed the microphone volume slider is maxed in zoom and no auto volume adjustment. I’ve also played around with toggling the various original sound options in zoom. 

My meeting participants hear everything fine at the expected levels when original sound is turned off, they also hear a drop off when I have it set on. They’ve also metered my output and things I’m told my levels are coming in around -30db when I have original sound on.

I’ve tested in other applications, DAWs, broadcast software, and don’t have this issue. As far as I can tell, this is isolated to zoom. Something I’m overlooking? Or perhaps a known issue?

2021-07-12 05:29:25,How to stop Zoom from cutting long silent bits out of my recorded meetings?,"TL;DR Zoom automatically cuts out extended periods of silence (muted mics) from recordings on a track-by-track basis, causing everyone to fall out of sync.



I produce a podcast for my towns college radio and we interview guests using Zoom. The issue I have is when using Zooms built in recording option.

I expected this to be a basic setting, or a FAQ response somewhere but I haven’t found anything addressing this issue yet so here I am.

Basically, I’ll load up the tracks from a meeting we recorded with 3 to 5 people. I line them up in my DAW, press play, and for a moment everything sounds fine. I ask a question, the guests respond in perfect sync, no problem. This changes after getting a few minutes in. For example if I ask a guest a question, then while they’re answering, for a few minutes I’m muted, that period of silence will be removed from my track, which causes my response to come back too early, over their answer as if I started talking over them and it’s just a pain in the ass. 

I end up needing to scrub to every point that one person starts talking and another stops, and check that it didn’t lose sync there. If I have to sync multi tracks at the start of a project thats no big deal but this is my job and I’m expected to work efficiently. If I could deactivate this and only have to sync the tracks up once I’d probably have 1/3 the work I end up needing to do.

We’ve recorded 7 episodes so far and up to this point Ive just tolerated it but I know there has to be a way I could be getting this done faster. If there’s a setting in Zoom I missed and I just look really dumb I would be so relieved.

Nobody hears any sound coming out of my screen when I share screen and I know that computer audio sharing is on. When I try to share my Sound zoom tells me to enter my password to install the zoom audio device and restart my audio sharing application, but it never installs anything or restarts anything. I only have one theory to what the problem could be, I downloaded a Voice modification app called MorphVox audio for a zoom play that I wanted to do. It never ended up working but I’ve had it on my computer for months and it hasn’t giving me problems now. Every time I try to share my screen and sound it shifts to that app being the mic and speaker. I just uninstalled the app completely from my computer, but when it tells me to select the microphone instead of just the application name it just says device name, so now when I try to share my sound it says mic and speaker changed to device name.

2021-07-13 00:26:41,"Users having issues hitting the ""Leave Meeting"" button","Over the past few months I have had several users at our company report to me that they were ""Unable to leave a zoom call"". Luckily at one point I was able to witness the issue first hand with a user after connecting with them remotely. What happens is that when they go to click the ""leave meeting"" button at the bottom right of their zoom call, the whole tools menu disappears (including the leave meeting button). Some of our users are able to use ""ALT + Q"" to leave their meetings but it isn't a solution we would like to rely on as we are consistently getting tickets about the original issue from users who aren't as tech savvy when it comes to quick key shortcuts and such. We have tried pretty much all that I can think of; updating windows, uninstalling/reinstalling zoom, running ""clean zoom"", doing test calls, turning on ""Always show meeting controls"" and still none of it has helped

I have opened a few different tickets with zoom support and haven't been able to find a solution. Most of the time I am just told to run ""clean zoom"" which as mentioned above hasn't done anything for us.

Most of our users use Dell latitude laptops with modern specs, all of them are on the latest version of windows as well as of this month. A lot of our users are also working from home so I was wondering if it had anything to do with their home internet connection. Another thing to note is that many users use Dell USBC Docking stations to extend their laptop view to multiple displays. I had a thought that maybe the dell docking stations were doing something screwy to the zoom window and that may be a reason.

So far I am at a complete loss. Any ideas would be much appreciated!

Recently, I've begun having an issue in which the Zoom audio just cuts completely out for me after doing this. It's always some random amount of time afterwards; could be ten seconds, or ten minutes. I can open up other apps and the audio is clear as day. Usually the only way I can find to fix it is to hang up and reconnect to the call, and sometimes that doesn't even work right away.

Sometimes I add a "":)"" smiley face or some other face to make my messages seem friendlier, but the Zoom Chat keeps auto-correcting it to an emoji. This is specifically for the Zoom instant messaging, not the chat in a video call. How do I stop this? 

It's not my system settings. I turned that all off. I don't see an option to stop this in Zoom preferences. It seems Zoom on MacOS just auto-corrects all faces into emojis.

I’d love to use my AirPods for audio since I can wear them all day with no problems and the audio is fine. I don’t have a ton of deal space for a mic and the space I do have would make it sitting approximately 8”-12” away.

2021-07-22 18:29:07,Account Problem,"Here's a tutor from abroad, and below are the situation that I am facing.

The question I gonna ask is at the end if you don't wanna read the story.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Because there's an agent in Taiwan, my boss chose to buy pro account from them instead of buying pro account from Zoom directly.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The first problem I met was resolution. Thanks to reddit, someone said that sending tickets to zoom, and users can be added to the whitelist in order to get 720p. So I sent tickets to zoom. They told me that I need the approval of account admin/owner to change settings.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It led to second problem. Shouldn't I be the account owner/admin? I'm an independent user, not a company's employee tho. I asked the agent where I get this account. It turns out that the agent owns  admin account. Once someone buys account, they gives member account to that guy. (They didn't tell me straightforwardly. I figure it out by myself at the end.) While I asked for the approval, they denied.

If I purchase pro accounts directly from Zoom, will I be the owner/admin of the account? 

Or I will still be the member of account?",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/Zoom/comments/opb569/account_problem/,ReefToTheMoon

2021-07-27 03:48:46,Microphone Cutting Out First Word or Part of a Word,"Question: I have a number of users experiencing issues with their microphone cutting out during a Zoom call. They can hear others without issue (audio coming in). They do not experience video pauses or delays (video does not freeze). They are informed that as they try and speak the first couple words are cutoff.

This is unique to Zoom. I have tested the same model (Dell Latitude 5310 2-in-1 and Latitude 7400 2-in-1) in Google Hangouts/Meet, MS Teams, and Skype and I have not experienced this issue. When they use headphones, a headset, or webcam the issue does not seem to occur any longer.

The best guess I can come up with is that there is an issue with the integrated microphone and speakers on these Dell models that does not work well with Zoom. It is as if Zoom is attempting to cancel out background noise and enables the microphone a half second or second late and the first part of the dialog is not picked up. If I continue to speak in an unbroken string of words the issue does not occur, but when I pause (very normal for either breathing or collecting thoughts) the microphone will cut out and miss the first word or part of a word before picking back up again.

I contacted Zoom support (10/2020), but I was unable to find a suitable solution based upon the guidance and steps they provided. We provided a webcam to the impacted users and tabled this until it arose again recently.

At this time, it appears the only solution I can offer my staff is to use a headset, headphones, microphone, or webcam and not to rely upon the integrated components.

2021-07-28 09:25:21,Issue with logging in via University Google Account,"Hey all, I have a quick question with university classes starting back up for me soon. 

At the beginning of the pandemic (around march of 2020 for my area) my classes switched to zoom correspondence. My university has a google-based email system, as i am sure many are. So when I booted up zoom for the first time, I used the ""sign in with google"" option. I logged in Chrome with my University email, and that was that. I never needed to log in again, as zoom automatically logged me in on startup of my PC.  
However, I have been out of class since may, and because I only use zoom for school, I disabled it from activating on startup (i dont have a great computer, and the computer gets *very* slow if I have too many programs launching on startup). I launched zoom for the first time in months today, in preparation for school starting. I attempted to log in with google, and signed in with chrome, as usual. However, instead of giving me the ""you have successfully logged in, you can close this page"" message I received before, it opened up what I can only assume to be the web version of zoom. My zoom app is still logged out. I am not sure how to remedy this.

I have started to use Zoom on the road, i.e. on my portable computer with a smaller screen than what I have on my desktop computer. Obviously, window management is a bit more critical.

One thing that bugs me is that, when I minimize Zoom windows, Zoom creates a tiny window on my desktop instead of minimizing to the taskbar. And then, even if I click on the taskbar, I can't resize the Zoom window to its normal size. I need to dig under other windows to find the Zoom window, and only then I can enlarge it.

Hence my question: Is it possible to minimize Zoom windows to the taskbar, just like when I minimize a window in Word or in the file explorer?

Hope you all can help me with this one. 
We use Gsuite calendar and Zoom for meetings. I am an admin on our Exec. Directors calendar, so I handle his scheduling. When I create his meetings I simply switch over to his google calendar. The issue is every time he needs to use Zoom it makes me a host instead of making him a host, even when I’m not invited to the meeting.
I’ve change the order I which I do things, so I always switch over to his calendar before even starting to fill in meeting details or zoom. So why does it keep making me a host and how can I make it so he’s the host of the meetings I organize under his calendar?

4. Tried changing my speakers in Zoom settings

8. Turned off all of my bluetooth devices
9. Deleted and reinstalled Zoom
10. Made sure that all of my hardware drivers were up-to-date
11. Deleted any other additional audio drivers in ""Control Panel"" (for bluetooth headphones and monitor speakers and things like that)

I recently upgraded to the most recent version of Zoom (5.7.4), skipping a few versions I'd missed, and now I can't annotate anymore. This issue seriously affects my work as I'm a teacher and need to use annotation tools for Zoom lessons.  
The tools show up, but I can't see what I'm drawing. Ironically I can still save my annotations as pics, but can't see them as I'm making them (except for text, which shows up while typing but disappears when I click out of the text box).  
I'm running Mac OS Catalina patched to work on an older 2008 Macbook Pro, and I'm concerned this may be the source of the issue, but I tried downgrading Zoom to a previous version (anything 5 and above, as 4 doesn't work anymore) and none of them seem to allow me to annotate anymore.

I'm at a loss and would love any advice. Thanks.  
Wasn't sure whether to post this here or on the [Catalina patcher Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatalinaPatcher/) but figure it's more Zoom-related.

2021-08-11 21:58:14,Processor Requirements for Share Screen Function,"While troubleshooting some screen sharing issues, I came across this at [support.zoom.us](https://support.zoom.us):

* Dual and single-core laptops have a reduced frame rate when screen sharing (around 5 frames per second). For optimum screen-sharing performance on laptops, we recommend a quad-core processor or higher.

A few questions:

1. Is this frame limitation set by the Zoom Meeting client software directly?  Or, is this some kind of hardware limitation that all single/dual-core laptops have that I've never known about before?
2. If this limitation is indeed set by the Zoom Meeting client, can it be changed to allow for higher frame rates when screen-sharing on a dual-core laptop?

Obviously, I could just upgrade my hardware/system and not worry about it.  However, I don't see any reason for this limitation if it *is* set by the Zoom client.  The load on my CPU when screen-sharing a video seems relatively light in my opinion.  (At least, light enough to boost the frame rate a bit more than 5fps).

And yes, I realize that there is a setting option in Share Screen to change the fps limitation anywhere from 1fps up to 15fps.  However, this hardware notation makes it sound like increasing the fps limitation, say to 15 fps or even just 6fps, isn't really an option with my current setup.

2021-08-17 20:26:45,Syncing your Slack status / DND to Zoom calls,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a new Zoom integration that just launched on Product Hunt today that's a huge help for users also on Slack: [Zoom + Slack status sync](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/zoom-slack-sync-by-reclaim-ai)

It basically allows you to auto-sync your Slack status to ""in a meeting"" or set Do Not Disturb (DND) when you enter or leave a Zoom call, even if it's not on your calendar or the meeting ends early.

So, instead of leaving yourself open to interruptions during your important calls, you can communicate context around what you're doing to your team so they can better understand if it's a good time to connect. It also leaves it up to you as far as how aggressively you want to defend against distractions, whether softly with a status update, or silence completely with DND when you're on a call. 

This feature is and will forever be, free forever at Reclaim. Zoom and Slack are essentials in our book, and you shouldn't have to pay to make these two play. I should also note that this is a complementary, not competitive, integration to Zoom's own Slack integration which is great for starting meetings, but does not offer status sync.

So anyways, as a Zoom superuser, we'd love to hear what you think. Check out the [Zoom + Slack status sync](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/zoom-slack-sync-by-reclaim-ai) tool on Product Hunt and share your honest feedback!

So my wife works for a hospital as a credential trainer. She teaches nurses on the Epic System. She works from home (we live in a new apartment that was built last year) and needs to teach remotely using Zoom. When she is sharing her screen and teaching it freezes for like 30 seconds, then comes back and does that several times through out the session. We have literally tried everything to figure out what it is. Some troubleshooting for your information:

1. I use zoom on my laptop and share my screen I do not have this issue.
2. She used a different computer from the hospital and tried it, but still had the same issue.
3. We got a new modem, but still had the same issue.
4. She tried teaching at different locations like her parents house or onsite at the hospital and both of those locations had ***no issues***, Zoom was working perfectly fine.
5. It is not the internet connection at our apartment because she hardwired using an Ethernet cable and still had the same issue. We preformed an internet speed test and all of the speeds were high.

We are thinking it has to do with the VPN, since she works for a hospital the security is super high...so maybe Zoom is having trouble communicating with the internet of our apartment plus the VPN security firewall is getting clogged up? I have no idea. She thinks it is the apartment itself, but then why does my Zoom have no issues? If it was the apartment layout/tech wouldn't it be affecting me as well? Btw all other video applications work for her no problem as well. Microsoft Teams works perfectly fine and does not have the same issue. This issue has been going on for months now and we are stuck. We tried calling comcast our internet provider and the hospital and we have troubleshot with them all...and they can't even figure it out.

 I tried every suggested fix, none worked.  However, what did work was changing the way my hp laptop is connected to the network router.  I was using a wired connection plugged into a usb-c hub connected to my laptop.  Someone in a hp forum suggested that usb internet connections could be the culprit.  Lo and behold, when I unplugged the usb-c wired connection and instead connect directly to wifi using my laptop's built-in wireless the problem dissappeared and has not come back!

What do you recommend I could do instead? I've tried various macro-recording apps in the past and they never seemed to work or were buggy. Maybe there's something new and streamlined? Win10 Pro.

My use case is I teach live fitness classes. It's great to start class in gallery view so everyone can see everyone and chat for a moment. But then I want to quickly (without needing to go back to the computer and fuss with the mouse) trigger ""Spotlight For Everyone"" Then programmed on the Streamdeck is ALT+M ""mute/unmute all except host (host only)"", which is AWESOME to quiet out dogs barking or people talking on the phone forgetting they're on Zoom and everyone can hear them. I'd like to program ""Spotlight for Everyone"" into the Streamdeck, but there's no global keyboard shortcut in Zoom for this. At the end of the class, I'd love to be able to trigger to turn Spotlight off so everyone can see everyone again and say goodbye, again without having to fuss with the mouse to do so.",1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,/r/Zoom/comments/pcymar/how_to_remote_trigger_spotlight_video/,bombadil1564

Our Requirements:  

* Audience will be upto 50k (or more).
* Speakers will be anywhere between 100-200.
* Pre-recorded videos will be played of famous speaker personalities to introduce them.
* Famous speaker personalities will then come live to answer questions of live audience.
* If a participant wants to share/ask something, they will raise their hand and admins might allow them to join as speaker.
* There will be local language interpreters and sign language interpreters.
* Audience must be able to view main speaker and language interpreters simultaneously.
* To avoid the platform getting crowded, non active speakers must be able to move themselves to the audience panel and come back to speaker panel whenever they want.

I hope you got the idea, I'm looking for a paid platform which can provide all these features. I'm not sure if zoom is the right platform. We don't want to compromise with quality, there should be no lag or delay, because some of the main guests are famous personalities.",1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,/r/Zoom/comments/pd79ym/conducting_a_webinar_on_international_day_of/,he_depressed

2021-08-29 20:05:27,Is it possible to have a hybrid meeting with audience participation?,"For the past year I have been giving Zoom lectures to quilting guilds across the country. I use the spotlight feature and engage in a conversation with the audience.  Eg. Who can tell me what this block is called? Everybody is at home and this has worked very well.

Now guilds are starting to meet in person again.  A hybrid meeting is where I (the lecturer) am in my studio, but the guild members are all in one room with a computer hooked up to a projector and speakers. The setup in most of these venues has the computer well away from the audience.  

The problem with this is that I can't hear any of the questions or comments from the audience. Is there any way around this? I tried having an audience member using a cell phone to log in, but ended up with echo and feedback.

Is there any solution to this problem?

Does Zoom webinar use unique link invitations or can multiple users use one link?

Can I include the link I get when I register for the webinar in the reminder emails for the webinar? Or does each registrant get a personalized link?  Zoom's help files on this are woefully lacking.

Our marketing guy has suggested that we deactivate the registration confirmation and reminder emails from Zoom, only having them come from our CRM, that's why I ask; I know that Zoom provides everyone with a link when they register, but not everyone adds it to their calendar (which they really should...) - so I'm trying to find a way to give them the correct link to join the webinar.

I can’t move the cursor or even turn off the laptop using keyboard or power button. Usually there’s a few minutes where just the zoom video white screens and I can still here audio before it completely crashes. When this happens the task manager is showing two separate .exe processes with one running and one not responding I’m guessing one is for audio and the other for video.

The mobile app experience seemed fine in comparison.

Whenever I use zoom for a meeting, sometimes I need to go into another program, while also staying in the zoom meeting with my video on. The voice cracks as soon as I go into another program, no matter who's speaking. A message also pops up saying, ""Low computer resources may be affecting audio quality. Please close other applications.""

But when I open Task Manager, there's only 60-70% usage of CPU and Memory.

2021-09-07 12:18:19,I can’t update user setting “When a cloud recording is available” option using Zoom API and there are no error message sent back," 

**Description**

I sent a patch request to update Zoom user setting ( enable “Meeting”/“Email Notification”/“When a cloud recording is available”). It only returned an empty string and “When a cloud recording is available” setting didn’t change status. Even though I can change that setting option on the account just fine. What is the problem here? And how to fix it?

**Error**

The request only return an empty string.

**App Type**

I’m using my company’s own platform. It does all the Zoom authentication in background, I only provide the API path and request body.

**Endpoint**

PATCH /users/{userId}/settings

**Steps to reproduce the behavior**:

1. Request URL: /users/{userId}/settings Header: { method: “PATCH” } Body: { “email\_notification”: { “cloud\_recording\_available\_reminder”: true }}
2. An empty string was returned. The setting option didn’t change.

**Additional context**

Unfortunately I don’t know much about the internal process of our company’s platform, so I can not show a log file here. But I tried getting user settings ( GET /users/{userId}/settings) and updating the same option on account settings ( PATCH /accounts/{accountId}/settings) just fine. Other setting options of user can be updated too, just “Meeting”/“Email Notification”/“When a cloud recording is available” option that has problem.

I have found some similar questions on this site and Zoom devforum, but it seems like they only used the wrong api endpoint or made a typo in json body. In my case the endpoint is correct (as mentioned above, I have successfully updated other user setting options), and my json body is correct too (successfully updated the same option on account settings).",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/Zoom/comments/pjfpu7/i_cant_update_user_setting_when_a_cloud_recording/,Bominus5

2021-09-09 21:29:24,Blackmagic pocket 4K + Zoom (Help),"Hi there, my company runs online courses for high school kids via Zoom and we are looking to upgrade our setup. 

Right now we're using the Sony A6000, hooked up an old laptop through a cheap Chinese HDMI capture card. 

We're looking to seriously upgrade our setup. We're looking to use it for Zoom meetings + YouTube. 

So here's my plan, due to bandwidth &amp; software limit, our streaming via zoom will only be at 1080p, 60fps. So naturally, I am looking to up the colour game as our the colours on the video for our previous setup was pretty blend. 

So I thought of getting the Blackmagic Pocket 4K. Since it's the cheapest option to shoot in raw and it has this feature where it can record internally whilst simultaneously streaming. My question is, will I be able to colour grade on the camera LIVE, to make the stream popping for the students?

My main concern is the camera, and your input and suggestion is highly appreciated. I'll leave the list of things I will be getting for my setup. 

- Blackmagic Pocket 4K
- Elgato Camlink
- Rode Lavalier Mic
- Softbox

2021-09-15 02:17:27,Multiple disconnects in 30 min call despite 300 Mbps speeds,"At my wit's end and turning to y'all for help.

I am using a Macbook Pro M1 computer operating macOS Big Sur Version 11.6 with WiFi speeds of 350 Mbps download and 317 Mbps upload, latency: 5 ms. There are only 2 other devices connected to the network. However, I am experiencing multiple disconnects in a 30 min Zoom call where video and audio freeze completely and sometimes reconnect me to the call entirely. At times when this happens, I sometimes experience lags with messaging apps as well so there is clearly an issue but I cannot find or solve it.

I pulled some of the statistics within Zoom bulleted below:

* Overall Stats: CPU Zoom 4.0%, overall 14%; Memory Zoom 364 MB, Overall 2.0 GB; Bandwidth 252 kb/s (send), 1220 kb/s (receive), network type wifi, proxy -, connection type, cloud, version 5.7.6
* Audio Receive: 24khz frequency, 35 ms latency, 1 ms jitter, 0.0% packet loss
* Video Send: 44 ms latency, 2 ms jitter, 0.0% packet loss, 320x180 resolution, 15 fps
* Video Receive: 41 ms latency, 0 ms jitter, 0.0% packet loss, 320x180 resolution, 11 fps

All of these stats seem in line with Zoom's guidelines. I have updated my Zoom, updated my macOS, restarted my computer multiple times, and changed rooms in my house and I continue to experience the same issues. Does anyone have troubleshooting advice or other tests I can run? It's not a sustainable option for me to use a wired connection with ethernet so would prefer to resolve the issue while still using Wifi.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/Zoom/comments/po8c8c/multiple_disconnects_in_30_min_call_despite_300/,millflorist

2021-09-15 15:32:09,Four Tweaks That Make My Life With Zoom More Comfortable,"I am on Zoom calls every day for 4-5 hours. Over the past year, I felt that I didn't like the process of creating, conducting, and ending a video call and found how to fix it:

1. When starting a call, you need to make a couple of extra clicks to get a link to the conference. It is treated like this - in the settings, put a checkmark ""Copy invitation link at the start of the conference"" and voila, the link is immediately in the buffer;

2. Regularly someone from the participants needs to show the screen, and by default, this is prohibited without the permission of the organizer. In the settings, we look for this and allow the screen to be shared with everyone and always;

3. When exiting the config, by default, Zoom asks for confirmation that I really want to leave it. In the settings, uncheck the box ""Ask me to confirm before I leave the conference"";

4. Allow all or certain contacts to enter the conference without confirmation - without my consent. If there is a link, then it can enter. I click less, and the interlocutor does not expect ""in the waiting room.""

&amp;#x200B;

Saves clicks and tens of seconds. Cumulatively, it will hardly take an hour in a year, but it's so nice not to waste yourself on nothing 😎

I'm writing an article about a phenomenon called Zoom Dysmorphia, where people develop dysmorphia about their appearance due to seeing themselves on screens.

I'm hoping to interview a few people who have struggled with BD or have even considered cosmetic surgery as a result of more screen time/video calls. You can remain anonymous if you'd like, though I'd want to include details like your age, city, occupation, along with details about your experience.

Please feel free to comment here, DM me, or email me at [ashleyabrmsn@gmail.com](mailto:ashleyabrmsn@gmail.com).

2021-09-20 01:20:51,Auto-call option for meetings? Like Amazon chime,"Hey all! First time poster here, sorry if this idea has been explored already, I didn’t find anything with a search here or in Google.

Is there an option to have an automatic pop-up to join a meeting when it’s time?

With Amazon chime, one minute before a meeting started, a prominent alert would appear over everything with meeting options to join, decline, or say you’re running late to snooze the alert. It was super convenient and I think would be an amazing feature to be able to add or build for zoom if it doesn’t already exist. In slack, I get a notification one minute before a meeting starts, but there’s no actual options to join from there. I still have to navigate to slack, go to the outlook calendar app, click the zoom link and follow along with those dialogs before I can actually join the meeting.

Example of the easy Amazon chime auto-call at the beginning of this YT video:

I was hoping I could possibly keep the gallery view while somebody is screen sharing so that I can see everybody else. I can extend the window to show a couple others, however, it still doesn't show everybody and I would have to manually scroll through to find whoever is talking. It would be ideal if I could just have the gallery view up and there just be a separate window for the screen share. This would be beneficial because I could see who has there hand raised and when and see who is actually talking.

We are looking for an app or extension for Zoom, to track login times.

We are using Zoom for prayer rooms: there are breakoutrooms, where we can send people to get a prayer. When people log in, they are waiting in the main session, where there is a ""welcome person"", who welcomes the participants. If a breakout room gets empty, the welcome person sends one person to the empty room.  The hard part is to remember the order of the people(its a 2 hour service, and there are usually around 20-30 people waiting for prayer), who logged in, so it usually happens, that some people wait longer, however they are logged in earlier.

Can somebody suggest a great app or extension to track the participants login times real time, so we can send the people ""first come first served"" to the breakout rooms? We tried Zhar, but it does not order the participants by login time, and name changes does not apply to the list.

Expanded options for the desktop client include bold, italics, underlining, strikethrough, **highlight and text color, font size**, bulleted and **numbered lists, hyperlinks, and indenting.**   The things I bolded are missing.     
Check the screenshot. There's no option for it in settings or in the web portal. I am the owner of this account  Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

Sensibly, I would find an ideal setting for the audio interface and use that every time,  but I would still need to make sure that the levels were good for the initial setting.

The privacy shutter is open and the camera does work when using the MS Win10 camera app.  So the hardware appears fine.  I have also tried switching through different USB ports - no change in behavior.

Today, occasionally, I can get the video to show up after restarting the pc.  However, after a successful start today, with live video in the Zoom setting video test screen, it stopped working in Zoom test, but a subsequent test with camera app had good video.

2021-09-29 08:50:31,Someone (not me) Cheated on a Zoom test today/: Could the instructor possibly have seen/noticed this? Should this person turn themselves in an effort to prevent matters from escalating?,"Someone that wasn't myself took an exam today and made an ***abominable*** decision to cheat on it. This person used an unapproved online calculator to help find solutions for a medium-portion of the questions. The person is new to Zoom and hasn't had much experience with it yet. Not that this should influence their behavior, but this student wasn't consciously aware that the instructor might have the ability to monitor the students's screens until mid-test, after the decision had already been made.:( After looking at zoom online resources, I saw some notes that said ""for a participant to share their desktop activities with an instructor, they must manually enable the sharing-feature themselves,"" or something similar. The whole meeting was recorded by the instructor, but the person can't remember/forgot to check if their screen-sharing was on. Oof. Not sure if this changes anything, but today's exam, unlike our regular lectures, was password protected. Could the instructor have requested screen-sharing to be enabled from the beginning of today's class, for example, like in a pop-up/pop-out menu, and the student didn't notice?

This person is worried that they possibly have already been discovered because they saw the instructor shaking their head around the time they did it, although that could be caused by more than one thing.

The student I'm referring to is filled with shame, guilt, regret for not studying more, and anxiety about getting caught/from being 'caught' already. This student is thinking about coming forward to the instructor with the truth, especially if it would prevent matters from getting worse. Although the student would face a punishment, the student would (probably) be allowed to stay in the class. What should this person do?

2021-10-05 04:45:42,Multiple cameras to one Zoom meeting,"We are trying to think of a way to better engage on-site people with the virtual people for meetings. One thought was to have multiple cameras in a room so people could sit socially distanced. Each camera would be on a small tripod in front of the on-site participant so that remote people could better see each participant. My thought was to have all of these cameras feed into one Zoom meeting so it looked as if many people joined in, though a chunk of them are in the same room together. 

Another idea was multiple laptops all joining the same meeting from the same room, but my thought is the logistics behind ensuring people are muting at the right time, joining the right meeting, not spilling stuff on laptops, etc., etc. would make it the more complex (and expensive) solution. 

I've seen that Zoom only supports 2 camera feeds so I'm not sure this would even be possible. Any ideas here would certainly be helpful.",1.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,/r/Zoom/comments/q1eqrw/multiple_cameras_to_one_zoom_meeting/,subdriven

I get 93Mbps upload and 70Mbps download with a wired ethernet connection to the router. However when in a Zoom meeting I turn both my video off and I am muted, I get the message that ""my bandwidth is low"" or ""you internet connection is unstable"" or ""poor internet connection maybe affecting your meeting experience"".

My internet connection is clearly not the issue. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Zoom, I've installed the 64bit version and nothing has fixed the issue. On my laptop which is older and connected wirelessly, Zoom works with no issues!!!

Still stuck on one detail. I have a link with embedded passcode that I am not hosting. I started by pasting this link into the Notes section of the Calendar entry, but when I clicked it, it asked for the passcode. When I enter the passcode it puts me in the meeting (alone since it starts tomorrow). I thought having Zoom look at my calendar to grab it and then re-add the event back into Google Calendar would maybe help, but it made a whole new link that didn't have the same meeting ID or passcode string. I tried editing this in browser Zoom and it then added the right passcode to the calendar in the section that follows the link in Notes, but the URL is still wrong and I still have to paste the passcode to join. So basically that was worse.

It would be nice to be able to see my scheduled unhosted meetings in my zoom app. But I really just want to be able to click a link and not have to track down the passcode. Bonus would be having Google or Zoom figure out the time zone difference from the meeting ID data so I can't screw that up. At this point it seems like fewest steps to: 1Figure time difference myself, 2 add to Google Calendar with link pasted into event Notes 3 Copy and paste passcode from same source into Notes 4 Set notification 5 Get into Calendar at meeting time and copy passcode 6 Click link 7 Paste passcode when prompted

I feel like there should be a more streamlined way to make this happen that I am missing.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/q2usge/passcode_embedded_yet_still_required_to_typepaste/,chiquitar

First, it opens at least three tabs. The main tab, the chat tab and the shared screen tab. What is the point of this? On Skype, for example, it's all in the same tab.

The ""command layer"" when a screen is shared is ANNOYING. I can't navigate the Desktop properly. Heaven Forbid trying to share my browswer's screen.

Sending files to atendees on chat is terrible. The thumbnail / preview is reidiculous. I always send, no one ever receives. It's almost as if there is something to be done before sending said files on the chat. 

&amp;#x200B;

NOTHING on Zoom seems to be intuitive. The ""command buttoms"" overlay my Desktop's taskbar. Why? Just why?

What I mean by ""intermittent"" is that this problem comes and goes. I start a meeting, I'm able to share the screen just fine. I stop sharing and when I share again, on my end, I get no error message. On the other end, people say they see a black screen with the message ""Dan has started screen sharing"" displayed.  
Things I've tried doing:  
1) updating my GPU drivers  
2) updating my integrated card drivers  
3) reinstalling drivers  
4) reinstalling Zoom  
5) adding Zoom as a personalized software to use integrated graphics  
6) adding cpthost.exe to use integrated graphics  
7) updating windows  


Nothing. Solves. The problem.   


I didn't  have this problem 2 weeks ago. It started happening ever since I started using a Presonus Audio Interface connected to a USB port (I don't think this is what's causing it) and I installed a second monitor through my laptop HDMI port (I don't think this is what's causing it either - since I tried without the monitor and still had the same problem).  


Please guys, I'm going nuts here since my job depends solely on Zoom. I need to get this fixed.

Since I have a Chromebook, the camera settings on Zoom itself are extremely limited. I believe my Zoom is fully updated on my laptop since I just bought it this month.

2021-10-12 23:25:39,Automatized broadcast to all rooms,"Hi, 

Is there an app (or any other way) to send pre-written messages to all breakout rooms automatically, after a chosen time?

I want to create group exercises that rely on a set of instructions that are delivered through time (to all breakout rooms).

I’d like to be able to write these instructions in advance and to connect them to a given time (e.g. ""0:00 - Start exercise"", ""3:00 - Do next task”, etc.)

This can take the form of broadcast messages (the default zoom feature to communicate with rooms), or any other solution.

I could create a ""dummy participant"" (webcam simulation) for all rooms, that displays instructions. But it seems super cumbersome and hard to customize (need to create a video for each set of instructions)
I also thought about making a script on the OS side (outside of Zoom) that simulates keyboard key presses, but there isn’t any shortcut to broadcast a message to all rooms, so I’d also need to simulate mouse clicks, which is more complex and less ideal

Any app or idea?

In other words- let’s say John is pre-assigned to Room 1 as the breakout group facilitator. Kerri is then randomly assigned into Room 1 during the meeting, so she gets sent into John’s room.

2021-10-13 14:03:59,Audio Not Working,"&amp;#x200B;

I joined a recurring meeting that previously had no problems. I automatically joined the audio as usual. The speaker was on. However I could not hear any participants. First I turned the volume up, to no luck. Then I disconnected my headphones from the computer so the call would be played from the computer speakers and again turned the volume up. I tested the speaker multiple times, switching from the computer speaker to my connected headphones. The first 1-2 notes of the ringtone were audible on both speakers but then cut off immediately. The participants' voices occasionally came through for a second but also cut off immediately to total silence.

To check that it was not a problem of my computer, I played music and youtube videos, which were inaudible. I then exited the meeting and replayed the youtube video and my music, which worked perfectly. I rejoined the meeting, and the same issues continued. I tested the audio, disconnected from the meeting audio and reconnected to no success. I restarted my computer, but it did not work. I left the meeting again and uninstalled the zoom app from my computer before downloading and installing the newest version of zoom. It still did not help.

My windows audio drivers are all up to date. The sound level in the mixer is also on.

A later test revealed that others are unable to hear me too. 

Speaking of which, even when zoom is functioning normally, I find that sounds from other tabs/applications cannot play normally (e.g. Youtube, music). The background music is cut out and vocals are clipped and subdued. When the host of a meeting plays a video in the meeting, the sound and music there also behaves the same way.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/q74wd1/audio_not_working/,Corno-cracker

I have been working on [Ease Attendance](https://www.easeattendance.com/)  for a while now (Started March 2021), and have grown to a user base of  over 1500 teachers. The idea of this project came to me when I saw that  my teachers would spend the first 5-10 minutes taking attendance and  waiting for everyone to come into the Zoom meeting rather than jump  straight into the lecture.

We are working with Cisco to intergate Ease Attendance with Webex and the expected launch of that is the end of this month.

Meeting records can also be exported to .csv files to other use.

All feedback is much appreciated.

The dude shares the recording link in an announcement after every lecture and I know there's a way for them to automatically be published because every other class does so. The professor is quite old and not tech savvy at all and I couldn't really find the information online. Basically what I want is to go to the Zoom tab on Canvas, and click on Cloud Recordings to access a list of all recordings. The list is empty for this one particular class.

I'm assuming it can be set up so that each lecture is recorded automatically, correct?

I'm also assuming that each recording can be automatically published after the meeting is done, right?

If so, how? Is there an official Zoom support webpage on this matter? I did some searching and couldn't find much; maybe I'm not searching right.

I've tried updating basically everything there is to update. Deleted and re-installed all audio drivers multiple times, updated BIOS and Windows. Checked all possible restrictions there might be as to why the Zoom desktop app wouldn't be allowed to use my mic and speakers. Checked settings on Zoom, no problems there. Everything shows up normally when testing the mic and speakers in the settings on Zoom (the audio detect bar moves when speaking into the mic etc.). The weird thing is that when accessing Zoom in Chrome, it detects the speakers but still leaves the mic undetected. I just recently disabled all enhancing functions on the mic and speakers (echo reduction etc.) but still no effect.

The input works totally fine, but the output coming out of Zoom through the interface is mono, so it only comes through Channel 1 of the interface -- which is the left ear only of a pair headphones. Is there a way to force a copy of Zoom's Channel 1 audio through Channel 2 of an audio interface? I can't find anything in Zoom's preferences to enable this. I've resorted to using a trial version of Loopback (attached image) but it only works for 20 minute intervals and I don't really want to pay $100 just to get sound in both ears of my headphones.

Because I am not the host of the meetings I also cannot be connected through my iPad and my PC simultaneously to record separately (at least I think you can do that as host, but I would not be permitted to be connected twice in these instances)

I built a new PC, and I thought I remembered reading somewhere that you could set up your iPhone or iPad as a camera for your PC and use it for Zoom. Has anyone done this successfully? Do you prefer one program or app?

As an alternative do current PC cameras have decent quality video without spending a lot?

I’m guessing it would be cheaper to get an app than a dedicated camera.

In my Zoom settings, I have the following configured:

* ""Stop my video when joining a meeting"" is **disabled**. As a result, I expect my camera to be **on** when I join a meeting.
* ""Always show video preview dialog when joining a video meeting"" is **enabled**. As a result, I to see a video preview dialogue whenever joining a meeting with video participants.

Despite this, whenever I join a meeting, I am dropped in without a video preview, and with my camera off. Does anyone know how this could be happening or what is going on? It seems like it is the exact opposite of my configured settings. Maybe there is some definition of ""video meeting"" that I'm not understanding, that doesn't apply to my meetings?

Our parents and teachers taught us the importance of eye contact. But what happens when these meetings are on Zoom? 

## There are many apps on the app store for Mac and Windows. For the purpose of these instructions I have used the [virtual teleprompter](https://vtpapps.com) app for Windows 10. Download the app on to your PC and then follow these steps...

**1.** Open the ""**Virtual teleprompter**"" from the **start menu**.

*Processing img 07r19qfjkcw71...*

**2.** Click the green ""**Proceed**"" button in the top left corner.

*Processing img 3labreelkcw71...*

**3.** **Paste** your speech or talking notes in the virtual teleprompter text-box. **Note**: this might be in MS Word, MS PowerPoint or notepad. Press the green ""**Start**"" button in the top left corner.

*Processing img 5xolql8okcw71...*

**4.** Change the font by hovering over the **Font** menu item.

*Processing img ho8d61vukcw71...*

**5.** Change the teleprompter transparency by hovering over the **transparency** menu item.

*Processing img 31nofb6wkcw71...*

**6.** You can **start** or **pause** the teleprompter scrolling by **pressing Enter** on your keyboard or **left click** on the speech. You can adjust the speed of the teleprompter scrolling by using the keyboard **UP** and **Down arrows**. Position the teleprompter ontop of your Zoom meeting so you have a nice overlay.

1.	The meeting was a work meeting with my friend’s employer

3.	The user accounts system on Mac OS should not allow for this, especially starting a meeting on one non-admin account and having it connect on an admin account… two weeks later.

2021-11-05 05:27:57,"Please help, coworkers are telling me I’m not hearing them when they try to interject during meetings","Hi everyone,

I’ve been working remotely like many people since March of last year. I have been on many Zoom calls since that time but was just today alerted to something unfortunate that has apparently been going on for months.

My coworkers have indicated that, when I am taking in a meeting and they try to interject, I’m not hearing them and will just keep talking.

Part of what makes this extra confusing for me is that, as a personality, I do tend to have a lot to say, and I also have a loud voice. It is not uncommon for me to go on for a bit when I’m making a point, and I’m likely going to be loud since I tend to have a bit of a booming voice, but I certainly do not ever want to talk over someone if they are trying to talk.

My boss told me that, earlier today, he was practically shouting my name to try and get me to stop talking so that he could get a point across. He said that I acted completely normal after I finished my sentence, awaiting a response, as though he had not just shouted my name several times. So this tells me there’s likely a technical issue, because obviously I’m not going to choose to keep talking if I hear my boss shouting my name so he can interject. 

Is anyone aware of existing issues that would explain this? Do you have any troubleshooting tips? I changed the “Suppress background noise” setting from auto to low in case that was creating the issue, after uninstalling and reinstalling Zoom. I’m not sure what else to try besides this.

I haven’t had any meetings since this issue was brought to my attention, so I haven’t had an opportunity to test, I’m going to start wearing headphones and I hope that will help. If anyone has other ideas, I’d greatly appreciate hearing them.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/qmv45k/please_help_coworkers_are_telling_me_im_not/,CypoeBur
2021-11-05 06:59:28,Zooms Remote Access Feature &amp; Possibility of Being Hacked While on Zoom,"At one specific (periodic) Zoom meeting I attend it almost feels like I am being hacked, kind of as if I've given access to my computer. The reason it feels that way is because periodically my mouse will kind of start slowing and moving on it's own (which can also happen if there is too much processing going on). Also, last time the speaker volume control went down to zero. I slid it back up. It went back down to zero. This happened repeatedly. I've had one other meeting where the mouse thing happened a bit. All other meetings are fine. 

I don't have any remote access programs installed. Last meeting I found out that paid Zoom has a remote access program built in. The reason I know is because at one point the presenter (who was sharing his screen) was having problems and finally the host asked if it was OK for him to access his computer to fix the glitch. I then saw the host moving through options on the presenter's screen and changing his Zoom setting to fix the glitch we were seeing. I saw that there is an actual program IN Zoom that allows for remote access.   

On the one hand, as mentioned it feels like my computer is being accessed. On the other hand, it's kind of hard to believe that guy would be doing such a thing. Also, my computer does slow when it gets overloaded from certain Zoom meetings, but never typically the sound turning down thing. It could even be a new bug with Zoom.

Is there a way that I can record or stream a Zoom Webinar with Stereo audio? 

Zoom has confirmed that it's not possible using their cloud recordings as they are automatically converted to Mono. I have also tried live streaming the session to YouTube and while I can download the VOD in stereo, it seems as if Zoom only sends Mono audio to the stream in the 1st place which means that doesn't work either.

The only thing I had seen now is that there does suddenly appear to be quite a few Zoom Apps so maybe it's possible using one of these apps? There are quite a few though so if anyone has found one that works then please let me know.

2021-11-11 05:55:17,My 1080p camera's quality is CRAP all of a sudden in zoom,I've been using a C922 Pro on my macbook pro 2019 for the last year and the quality has been crisp and clear and great (as good as zoom will allow at least).  Then a few weeks ago I joined my morning work meeting and the camera looks like total crap.  I messed around a bit trying to enable/disable HD in zoom settings etc and still no dice.  So I wanted to see if it was the camera or just zoom. I opened up quicktime to record a video and it looked great!  But when I open zoom it's shit again.  I switched the setting in zoom from HD to not HD and in fact the HD setting is WORSE than having the box unchecked.  Any ideas??

2021-11-12 00:47:06,I get an AMD driver timeout notification when using Zoom,"I've played around with different combinations under the advanced video settings menu. Currently I have optimize video quality checked, hardware acceleration for sending video and virtual background checked, and then hardware acceleration for video processing and receiving video unchecked. I'm pretty sure I've  had all of the hardware acceleration boxes checked at one point. [This](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-14-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-1tb-ssd-moonlight-white/6452913.p?skuId=6452913) is the laptop I have, if anyone's curious about what graphics and processor I have. 

So I'm getting a screen freeze + black screen that lasts a few seconds that almost exclusively happens when I'm using the Zoom app. After the black screen disappears my screen's color display changes a little bit for some reason and I get a notification from AMD that says there was a driver timeout. I played around with the settings on Zoom, tried hardware acceleration both on and off. It seems a bit better when I turn off my external webcam but it still happens probably at least once per class. I made sure there were no updates I needed (I'm still on windows 10 though), there were a couple on the AMD and Nvidia GeForce Experience apps but that didn't make a difference either. I haven't been tracking temperature but usually for class I keep my laptop in my lap and stays warm, but not hot. Right now my CPU is 55°c and I'm in class. When I'm gaming, my laptop gets much hotter in comparison -- sometimes I do get these weird frame rate drops that aren't from lag or latency issues but seems to be hardware, maybe graphics card, issues (it happens online and offline, sound gets chopped up too). I think that might be a result of my laptop overheating but with Zoom I'd say temperature couldn't be a problem.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/Zoom/comments/qrpdnq/i_get_an_amd_driver_timeout_notification_when/,schr0d1ng3rs_c4t

2021-11-18 09:54:01,Have to teach online and having so many problems please help,"Hey all I have to teach online now but so many of the features aren't working for me and I can't figure out why. In case it's relevant I have a MacBook computer. The problems are:
-trying to schedule a meeting: I go into the app and click on schedule on the home page. It gives me a list of options for setting up a meeting then when I click schedule it asks me to sign in again (even though I already was). Then when I click on my account it says ""could not find the selected meeting"". Why won't it schedule it!!
-every time I put students into break out rooms like half of them don't go and I have to try again
-it only lets me send very short chats
-when I try to DM people I go to the drop down menu and only a few names appear. Why can't I message the rest? The setting for the chat are that anyone can direct message anyone. 
-the option for me to send documents does not appear 

Can anyone help please?? Thank you so much in advance I'm really struggling. Never had to teach this way before and I look like an idiot in every class trying to make the tech work",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/Zoom/comments/qwer4o/have_to_teach_online_and_having_so_many_problems/,thatbtchshay

2021-11-23 21:54:46,"Zoom's ""Hybrid World of Work""","Shares of Zoom Communications (Nasdaq: ZM) dropped 6.8% in after-hours trading on Monday following the release of quarterly earnings results from the video platform.

Financials: Zoom reported a $1.11 earnings per share and revenue of $1.05 billion, both were better than expectations. Future guidance was also slightly better as well.

Deeper Dive: While third-quarter revenue is up 35% year-over-year, it is below the growth that the company reported during the same period last year.

Bigger Picture: Zoom is preparing for a potential post-pandemic world. The company has rolled out new tools for hybrid workforces, but there is also a lot of competition from other tech businesses.

Quote: “We are well on our way to becoming an indispensable platform for enterprises, individuals, and developers to connect, collaborate, and build in the flexible hybrid world of work.” - Zoom founder and CEO, Eric S. Yuan.

Final Thoughts: Is there a future after the pandemic for Zoom?

I’m an educator, and I’m really sick of using the annotation tool with my touchpad on my MacBook Pro to mark up my students documents, so when one of my colleagues told me I could screen share my iPad, I was excited to be able to use the pencil to mark it up!

However, MOST of the time, my iPad just says “unable to connect to [macbook pro]” when I do screen share&gt;share over airplay and then select my zoom room from screen mirroring on my iPad.

Everything I’ve found says that I need to make sure that ports are open on my router for this to work. I use a Mac and I’m not quite sure how to go about this process.

2021-11-29 23:09:24,Zoom and third-party screen recording software,"Hi.

I've read thousands of comments all over different forums online in regards to the fact that the host of the Zoom meeting is not able to detect third-party screen recording.

I've been using it myself a few times but to my surprise unfortunately a colleague of mine experienced it otherwise and I'm trying to find out if anyone as an idea of what is behind it or if someone as experience something similar.  


* He only installed ZOOM on windows, nothing else was requested by the host to be installed and and also used flashback recorder (trial) as the third party software for screen capture.
* The meeting was an online course with multiple participants and after 5 minutes or so the connection was abruptly interrupted like if the internet connection failed or something.
* After trying back to login again a few times without success, my colleague finally managed to enter the meeting again
* Two other participants mentioned the same problem logging back into the meeting
* Since the host started saying things like ""if someone here wishes to have the meeting recorded please let me know"", my colleague assuming that he had been caught, decided to call him after the session to apologize but apparently the teacher wasn't aware that it was really him, but knew that it had been one of the people who had the problem logging back into to the meeting.

This is all very strange to me... is it possible there is some special version of zoom out there or someone has found a way to use some service of their API for special purposes?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/Zoom/comments/r4xurb/zoom_and_thirdparty_screen_recording_software/,Cal2021_AM
