2021-06-07 19:30:11,Teams Contacts Issues,"Hi all,

I've recently started using Teams for phone calls, I'm otherwise pretty invested in the M365 system so figured it would be nice and easy to integrate.

Call quality is great, use of the application is all working fine, however my Exchange contacts won't reliably load into Teams.

I'm a small business so only have ~400 contacts, not a huge amount, however no matter how much I sign out / restart / re-install Teams, only around 20 contacts show.

I've also tried on a completely clean install of Windows, install Teams, log in, and the same 20 contacts are showing. 

Teams Web App is exactly the same.

If I add a contact via Teams, it immediately appears in my Exchange contacts in Outlook and suddenly contacts start loading in Teams, however still only loads about 100. If I quit Teams, or reboot, it's back to the original same 20 after re-opening and I have to add a contact again to get the 100 or so back.

My colleague on the same tenant is experiencing very similar behaviour. The ideal would be to have a shared contact list; bizarrely this doesn't seem possible. This is mad considering it's a platform literally designed (and named!) around collaboration and teamwork.

All of the contacts are formatted in the same way, and have phone numbers and business names. Some that are showing up are identically formatted to others that aren't.

Has anyone experienced this before and have any ideas on a fix?

Is there any option to share contacts across users on Teams?",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/nua41j/teams_contacts_issues/,Afraid-Bread

She's recorded her session, which includes playing a linked video (with sound) from YouTube, and also playing an embedded audio clip in one of her slides.

It appears that SharePoint sites created by Teams do not follow the external sharing settings you configure in the SharePoint Admin Center under Policies-&gt;Sharing-&gt;External Sharing.  By default any site created by Teams have an external sharing setting of New and existing guests, event if I have my org-wide external settings set as permissively as possible.  


So to allow anonymous links on files stored in Teams, I still have to change the external sharing setting on each individual site that was created by Teams, in the SharePoint Admin Center.  If a co-worker or client creates a new Team two weeks from now, a SharePoint administrator has to go in and adjust permissions before the Team allows anonymous links.

Suddenly, we see randomly that the default ""pofile picture"" of a Team is not displayed in the channel.

So the channel name is kind of distorted and doesn't show nicely.

I then tried to change the profile picture of the Team, and I get this error:

""There was a problem saving the photo. Please try again.""

&amp;#x200B;

Even when I delete the default picture and save, it displays the same error.

When deleting the default picture, it then only shows the first letters of the Team name. So no picture at all, but still can't save.

Attendees would see the polls, regardless of if they using the web, Teams App, or Mobile App.

My issue is when we delete a Team the Team will delete however things like the SharePoint online corresponding entry stays there and will not let me remove out of the admin center because ""a retention policy is keeping it"".

Microsoft's response is that we have to exclude by retention policy every group/sharepoint site and then wait for that to process before we can safely remove it out of SharePoint Online.

My whole argument against this behavior is that with Exchange Online usually mailboxes go to ""inactive"" but do not show up in the management console and/or it seems like a tedious oversight.

When we hung up it showed that that individual had been added to our chat stream. I removed them immediately but then got the message that they’d still have access to chat history.

Wondering what “chat history” that is? Is it just the history of the time from when they joined the chat to when they left ? (I.E the duration of the call)? Or the full chat history 18+ months. 

There’s certainly nothing bad in the chat string, just some personal information that would prefer not be shared to those not intended.

My organization does not have O365, so in order to accept the teams invite, I had to create a Microsoft account to accept the invite to their teams organization that they sent. Once I did that, it worked great for a few weeks. This past weekend, however, I had a windows update installed on my PC. Teams was signed out when I came back on Monday, so I attempted to log back in. Once signed in, it became apparent that I no longer had access to the organization as a guest. I couldn't see any of the team content.

What is weird, is that I still get the messages for things that I have missed. So I launched teams through the browser and signed in with the exact same credentials, and I can see everything just fine. I've talked to the organizer, but she is at a loss for what to do. What can I do to get teams to function in the desktop app again?

The only difference I notice is that in the desktop app, the menu up top has the name of my organization. When I click on it, it says ""Microsoft Teams free"" up top. It also gives me the option to switch between my organization and ""Personal"" directly in that menu. In the web browser, the menu is actually my name. When I click on it, I do not see ""Microsoft Teams free."" There is also an ""Account &amp; orgs"" button, that is not in the desktop app. When I click on it, it shows me the name of the organization that is overseeing the teams account. 

I'm not sure what to do, but this is really frustrating.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/nwpdhb/help_with_using_teams_as_a_guest_of_an/,hibbert0604

2021-06-13 22:50:51,Urgent - Caller ID from external users - iOS App,"I am the IT Admin for one of the Organization in Canada. We have one weird issue on MS Teams; iOS App.

We are currently trying the Business Voice with MS Teams. When someone from external/mobile number users call us, it shows City Name instead of Phone Number. 

We have tried to contact the MS support but no luck

We have tried to call from each and every external carrier available in Canada such as Bell, Rogers, Telus, Fido, Koodo, Virgin Mobiles etc and result is the same.

As a business, when someone calls, it is the most important thing to know the phone number number of person calling instead of city name. 

I am also in IT, so what I found that:
When someone calls from external/mobile numbers, Microsoft Teams get two details from the carrier. 
1. Phone Number
2. City Name

I think while coding this app, Microsoft has put the value of City Name on the caller ID field instead of Phone Number.

When same account is being used in Mac OS and Windows 10 app, it shows both. Number and City.

Is there anything I need to do in policy/settings? I haven’t changed anything. Everything is default.

I'm turning to the wisdom of the crowd/maybe someone will see this and can escalate my ticket to get some answers. I've got Surfaces in the docks with swollen batteries that need to be replaced but I can't replace them because the script to create deployable media is broken. 

I've had a ticket open with microsoft support for 3 weeks and all their engineers say it's incompatibility with my OS, but I've ran this script on Win10 Pro before, and just to appease them, I installed Win10 Enterprise and ran it, still failed at the point when trying to download drivers for the Logitech SmartDock platform.

I bought one of these because it sounded like it would be great. In some ways it is, in some ways it isn't. Here are my first impressions. Interested in anyone else's.

# Plus:

1. It looks and feels like a quality item. Almost like Avaya build quality. The screen looks very good and clear - especially in dark mode.
2. Setup couldn't be easier. Plug into the mains and USB. Done.
3. The ability to Bluetooth connect your cellphone/mobile is great. All calls (Teams or Mobile) can be made or answered from the Yealink. You can also put your phone in a position where it gets the best reception (if it is weak in your office).
4. Sound quality is very good. It's also nice to be able to answer a Teams call by just lifting the receiver (rather than answering via the PC). This is especially true for ""quick"" calls where you don't want to be putting on headsets etc. By default it answers ""audio only"" and you can then choose to enable video via the PC.
5. Outbound calling (Teams or Cellphone/Mobile) is soooo much easier than using any softphone PC based solution.

# Minus:

1. Does not work with Teams if you also have Skype for Business installed. It will pick up Skype Calls only. You can use it as a speaker and mic, but you must answer Teams calls via the PC. If you're *only* running Teams it works fine.
2. Does not reconnect to Teams after shutting down the PC and restarting, even pressing the ""Teams Button"" on the phone. You need to unplug and reinsert the USB to get it to reconnect.
3. If  you change Teams tenant (Either log into another Teams account that you have access to, or switch as a guest to), the phone still remains showing the first identity, and you need to unplug and reinsert the USB to get the new one.
4. If you are in the UK, the date on your PC needs to be set to US format MMDDYY. If not, the Yealink sets the date and displays the wrong one (10th June 10/6/21 is translated on the phone to 6th October, and there is no regional setting on the phone to correct this).
5. Does not have access to your contact list / address book (on Teams or the Bluetooth connected phone). Makes outbound calling difficult.
6. The Yealink software to change phone settings doesn't do much (very few options). I guess it's mainly to update firmware.",1.0,15.0,0.9,37.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/o08it3/yealink_mp50_thoughts_and_opinions_after_a_week/,Thermidor2

2021-06-16 02:02:55,I used to be able to click off of a shared screen if a presenter was done but didn't click 'stop sharing.' Are there no longer any options to do this?,"Until a month or so ago, when someone shared a screen, my participants appeared in a horizontal gallery at the bottom of my screen. Then I guess an update occurred and now when someone is sharing, the gallery is vertical on the right side of my screen. I don't mind this either way, but when this change occurred, I also lost the ability to click off the shared screen and go back to strictly gallery view. I am frequently in meetings where someone is sharing their screen to discuss certain content in the beginning of the meeting, but then in the back half of the meeting we're discussing other things and no longer need the shared content. Pre-change, I'd click on any of the participants' video and the shared screen would minimize and I'd get gallery view back (the shared screen was still available to bring back up if I wanted to, but it wasn't dominating the screen anymore). Now, I cannot minimize the shared screen. I can pin or focus on one participant at a time, but I can't get back to a gallery view and am left having a meeting with the tiny smushed video screens of my coworkers in that righthand panel while the shared screen is dominant with no option to close it (right clicking it only produces the option to ""copy"" and the gallery option in the display settings is greyed out). 

Is there anything I can do on my end, or is my only option to ask the presenter to stop sharing? (Which seems awfully rude and petty in the middle of a meeting).",1.0,1.0,0.67,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/o0kj9h/i_used_to_be_able_to_click_off_of_a_shared_screen/,tvgirl48

Some of the stuff might be shared in confidence and I don't want to erroneously tell them they are safe if my freaking boss sneaks in and listens in on the conference call. 

We made a certain goal and before we could present it to management, they whipped around and presented it to us, so I guess I'm a little worried they are just listening in and taking our ideas before we can present them lol.

We got a question about creating some sort of ""virtual water cooler"" functionality.  Essentially, an open meeting that people could pop in and out of at any time.  The thought is if you need a break or have a few minutes free in your schedule you could pop in and chat with anyone else that might be available.  Kind of how people would pass each other in the hall or on the way to the break room in an office.

It seems like creating a ""WaterCooler"" channel in Teams would accomplish this.  Anyone in the channel can click the meet button and anyone else can join the meeting.  The piece we seem to be missing is a notification for channel members that someone has started a meeting.  Even if people enable all notifications for the channel, nobody seems to get a notification when someone starts an impromptu meeting.  If we tag @ channel,  people get notifications for that, but what we're looking for is a way for people to get notifications when a meeting starts in a given channel.

2021-06-17 06:14:55,How to Automate MS Teams Installs and Updates,"I'm a Systems/Network admin for a company who utilizes MS Teams as a collaborative tool.  As we begin re-opening the office for users to come in, the IT Ops team is working to ensure Teams is installed and updated on machines that are in common use areas, such as collaboration/project rooms.

We have re-imaged these machines to have the latest OS/drivers/updates.  As a result, previous network profiles have been removed and users will need to sign back in to get the profile built and ready for use.  We are running into a challenge where we need to figure out how to install Teams on the yet-created profiles without having the login info for those users.  The impact becomes greater the higher up the hierarchy the user is.

Is anyone else in a similar situation where you need to get Teams installed on profiles that don't exist yet?  I've reached out to vendors I work with that are more knowledgeable around the O365 environment and apps and they have all responded the same: ""We don't have an answer/solution"".  Short of changing each user's password, logging in to allow the profile to be built, and letting the Teams machine installer do its thing, I don't have a good solution/answer to this issue.

Hopefully one of you have a similar experience/situation and have some insight on this.",1.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/o1h3lv/how_to_automate_ms_teams_installs_and_updates/,Mr-Whizbang

Recently I discovered Microsoft Teams and the Suite which has done wonders for my use-case migrating from Gsuite and Trello however its still not enough.

Usecase-

1. Multiple Businesses = (multiple Office accounts)
2. Some businesses have multiple brands or sister businesses = (Multiple Channels, Groups, Teams, boards)
3. Each Brand has specific needs and its own boards which require consistent diligence and accountability (Social Media, Advertising(Facebook, IG, Google, Pinterest....), Development, SEO...)

about 10 people per each business (placeholder)

My issue right now is managing all operations and having consistent task management, I want some sort of flow state solution as tasks are often dependent on prerequisites which can be multi dimensional. Once tasks are completed I want flows to go to the right people and if the flows are not moving I want the right people to be alerted that they are not moving.

2021-06-18 18:44:09,(MTR) Teams Room Configuration - Missing Display Room Information.,"Hi. I work on the estate with several different MTRs on the same underlying hardware.

I have about 3 different MTRs where I have taken away the license and re-added it using portal in 365 to adjust the push and that has caused the Displaynames to disappear. ( I did it to resolve the issue with Dial Pad not showing up).

[Example of the problem and what it looks like.](https://preview.redd.it/v85f8qb960671.png?width=2577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=287d4f45d266115921dbac0273c0f5e36e774c41)

&amp;#x200B;

[there should also be a display of what's the name of the room on this display.](https://preview.redd.it/xr52623k60671.png?width=1776&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d9065e647597a5beec9794969f471af6e738c81)

Now I saw that someone else also had that issue, however I don't think mine is related since the accounts are created as resource accounts and they have a Meeting Room License assigned to them. (Running hybrid environment, but the resource accounts are not on prem synched).

[https://www.graham-walsh.com/missing-room-name-in-mtr-app-4-8-19-0/](https://www.graham-walsh.com/missing-room-name-in-mtr-app-4-8-19-0/)

Both of the MTRs are running the same version of software:

&amp;#x200B;

[Version of software](https://preview.redd.it/zkpycyor60671.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca7762bfe32713867392847319245a1cecd5046f)

Is anyone aware of what could be causing those issues? 

Also, all other functionality is working besides couple of MTRs missing the name from the display Board.

Would appreciate if you guys have any pointers that could help in resolving this.",1.0,3.0,0.81,12.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/o2m7ji/mtr_teams_room_configuration_missing_display_room/,dziedzic1995

2021-06-18 19:24:30,Unable to change scheduled time of webinar to 15 minute increments on registration form,"Has anyone else experienced this issue?  
I want to schedule a webinar from 12:15 until 13:15.

On the webinar creation screen I can either choose the time from a dropdown list with 30 minute increments (by default). But I can also type in the scheduled time myself and change it to 15 minutes past the hour. That's great.

[Webinar creation screen](https://preview.redd.it/h8klokxmd0671.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=549f13c8a52eb9a9da8eeeea63e91b91f617c513)

When I also want to create a registration form however, I can not type in the scheduled time. I only have the option to choose from a dropdown list with 30 minute increments. So I can not change it to 12:15 and 13:15. I can only select 12:00 and 13:00 or 12:30 and 13:30.

[Registration form](https://preview.redd.it/cl3iie5ld0671.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b46a13e59a583eccdafe3cef6cd2332070c3f2a)

To make matters worse. When people register for the webinar, the scheduled time on the calendar invite they receive by mail is that of the registration form and not of the webinar itself.

Don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this, but seems like another glaring oversight by Microsoft...",1.0,1.0,0.67,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/o2mutq/unable_to_change_scheduled_time_of_webinar_to_15/,SysAdm1n2019

The training should be enough to be able to write the exam associated with each course plus it will greatly benefit you in the workplace.

I truly hope this helps someone out there that needs the held. I remember what it feels like wanting to learn something like these courses and needing to write the exams but not being able to find any resources, at least not any free ones that is.

So.

Now that we have newfangled no-sim smartphones in every warehouse worker's pocket for scanning inventory, we'd like to do this better.

In the Teams Admin Centre I can input all the details as normal, but when clicking save it simpley says ""We couldn't save the changes to $resourceaccountemailaddress."" I've managed to create these in PowerShell before, however much like my previous issue, it was done using the Skype for Business Powershell Module, which is no longer supported.

Now I use the cmdlet ""Connect-MicrosoftTeams"" to start with. I can use ""Get-CSOnlineApplicationInstance"" to see all of the Resource Accounts I've made in the past, but when I put in the following:

`New-CsOnlineApplicationInstance -UserPrincipalName $ResourceAccountUPN -DisplayName $DisplayName -ApplicationId 11cd3e2e-fccb-42ad-ad00-878b93575e07`

Got an issue where a customer has calls disconnecting when transferring to another local MS Teams user.

Looking at call traces, i can see the call flow is as expected, but then upon the re-invite with 'no audio' from Microsoft is sent back to the carrier leg, we see an ack with 'no audio' and then around 10 seconds later we receive a BYE from the carrier leg.

The user is adamant they are not manually disconnecting the call, which was at first expected due to no ringback audio while the user is on hold being transferred.  Implementing ringback audio on SBC level is not possible at this time. Testing proves the only network where we receive this BYE after the re-invite with 'no audio' is direct with O2. Most other networks have been tested and proven to work.

Has anyone experienced this issue and can confirm if O2 has an auto-disconnect due to receiving no-audio?",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/o719dn/no_ringback_resulting_in_o2_calls_dropping/,Birtyyy

2021-06-25 18:03:14,Multiple issues with desktop app for Windows 10 surrouding test calls and permission pop-ups for Tasks,"Hello everyone,

for work related reasons I found myself installing and setting up Teams (desktop app) on my personal computer running Windows 10. While the installation went fine, my mic, headphones and webcam are detected and working and my own conference seems to be working as far as I can tell, I did encounter some issues.

First off, I re-installed the app multiple times, deleted the contents of ""%appdata%\Microsoft\Teams"" each time, and did a couple of computer restarts. The issues persisted with GPU acceleration turned on and off and animations being turned on and off. Oh, and I tried searching for the issues of course, but didn't find much if anything at all.

The problems are sorted from most important to least important to me.

**1. Permission pop-ups constantly returning:**

During all my testing I restarted the app a lot of times. Sometimes, a pop-up greets me and says the following: ""We need to ask for additional permissions. You should only need to do this once for Tasks."" I can either click Cancel or Continue with the same result: The pop-up will apear 2 more times. After that, another popup comes up, saying ""We couldn't establish a connection to Teams. Please reload to try again."" After clicking reload, the first pop-up will show up 3 times again. Pressing the ESC key and clicking on different spots gets rid of the popups and let's me use the app. I wasn't using any VPN or proxy. I allowed Teams access to both private and public networks in the Windows firewall. Do I need to open a specific port as well?

**2. Test calls not coming through or continuing to ring:**

When doing a test call, in 40-50% of cases it works like it should and how I know from Skype. But sometimes, I only hear that ringing sound forever. Other times, I hear nothing at all and the call doesn't start. Sometimes, the call is accepted but the ringing keeps going in the background, even after I end the call. This issues appears when doing test calls - a conference with a friend seemed completely fine - but I really don't want anything similar to happen during important calls.

**3. Screen flickering:**

During these test calls, I get pretty bad screen flickering. My camera preview is small in the bottom right corner, sometimes becoming a black rectangle. The main window constantly changes from some sort of fading violet to plain grey and back again. Both happens irregularly but probably about every 2-3 seconds. I think it's showing me if the robot-lady or me is talking, but the timing doesn't quite add up and seems delayed and/or random. There are also ""dark flashes"" every so often, remaining there for probably 0.25 seconds. It almost seems like there's a conflict in what the program wants to show. Again, my test conference with a friend didn't have any issue like that.

A few more details: I'm using a GTX 1070 with the most recent driver 471.11, I also installed every available Windows 10 update. I shut down every process that could interfere with Teams. I'm using a high refresh rate monitor, maybe that could be the reason for the flickering?

If there is more information you need, please let me know. Thank you!",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/o7kowo/multiple_issues_with_desktop_app_for_windows_10/,Pilzemann
2021-06-25 20:08:53,Teams collaboration advice,"Hi everyone

I work for a boutique tech/business consultancy, and I've been looking at how I can create internal sites for various different topics to have all related info in one space. The kind of topics I'm thinking are sustainability, consumer trends, cloud, AI/ML, etc... then further broken down into things like interesting articles (brief description, date, link, tags), training courses (internal and external), client work/deliverables (assuming any add ons don't pose a security risk), and potentially other things. So a site for a topic, with different sections (and potentially different structure) for each sub-area. The idea is to have a knowledge repo for my company, so existing and new staff can see what we have around certain topics relevant to our business which we can keep adding to.

I've been playing around with Teams today, and I have seen some things like lists, wiki, etc., plus a mountain of third party add ins. The standard MSFT ones would theoretically work but are a little dry, and lack some customisation and the ability to add tags (which would be useful for articles that don't plainly fit in one area). And I don't want to go through every single one of the third party ones if I can help it!

Assuming the above makes sense, would anyone have any suggestions on how to customise Teams for the above, which add ons might be useful, etc.?

It would be nice to start a more interesting space, and move away from Excel sheets stored in Teams with lists of things!

I'm doing free training on the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Course (AZ-900). Will also be covering other Microsoft courses as well as courses from other vendors.

I will be covering the full AZ-900 course and my intention is to do this with other courses too. Really hoping this helps someone out there. This should be more than enough to be able to pass the Microsoft International Certification Exam and should also prove useful in the workplace for those that just want to learn more or those that need to troubleshoot something.

In case someone wants to point out that the AZ-900 specifically is also delivered for Free by Microsoft, yes I'm fully aware of that. You do however normally need to book that and can only attend on certain times. It also comes down to preference. Some people just connect better with other people's way of presenting something.

Have a look at my way of delivering and if you don't like it, well then don't watch it lol. I normally tend to go the extra mile with the topics. I don't just explain the theory you need to know for the exam but I also add a little extra. I also cover most topics practically by actually demonstrating them on the Microsoft Azure portal. :)

2021-06-28 16:56:59,"""Something went wrong. Try again."" When changing options"," Hello Redditors,

I am hosting a bigger meeting on Wednesday through MS Teams and encountered difficulties in adjusting the settings.

I'll  preface by saying that deleting the meeting and re-doing it is not an option, since the link has already been shared with a large group of  people.

The issue: When I try to modify the settings  (either through browser or by starting the meeting and editing the  settings directly inside it), the save button does not turn blue,  therefore not allowing me to change the settings. In the app, the  ability to save the settings also does not work.

I attach screenshots from both the app and the web settings (I tried adjusting settings for mic and camera for attendees) to give you an idea.

I have a peculiar problem. I use screen share a lot in meetings with my team.

As far as I can tell with the new layout you cant do that. You can see small videos on the top or on the side but cant get rid of the screen share of the other person.

atm we are using S4B onprem and have a software that imports our ERP contacts into skype. Because of MS does not provide any possibilities so allow 3rd party software to made a rnl software we are looking into other solutions.

A lot other people using the AAD/Exchange Contacts for this problem. Now i like to experiment with them and i dont get it to run.

I have an EXO Mailbox, Teams License with a calling plan. Our SBC have the right configuration for the Number forwarding to teams (our MSP doublechecked it). 

Now i created multiple contacts to see which config i really need. 

\- OnPrem Contact which is synced to AAD  
\- Exchange onprem contact (listed in addressbook)  
\- Exchange online contact (listed in addressbook)

All contacts have an email address and telefone number in the correct format (+49123456789)

Unfortnuatly Teams does not resolve the number. I guess i miss something, but there are no documentation or tutorials out there how i have to setup this.

For our normal ad accounts the rnl works fine. Also with personal teams contacts.

Question to the community about Teams, and audio in live events.  
If I'm doing a live event for company staff and am using RTMP and doing the event through OBS, the audio and video are great. No problems and I'm happy. However, doing a live event for the public means I have to use Teams as the production app for the event. From one angle, that is fine as it's easier for my staff, but even with all noise suppression settings in off mode, the audio is awful, mics sound bit crunched and music sounds like it is going through the noise suppression. Am I missing something? Or is it just Teams and that's that?

All the communication in the meetings is through text chat, so even though only 2-3 of us need to be chatting in the meeting all 50 employees get message notifications. What do I need to be looking at to change this behavior?

Previously it worked as I wanted it to and only the users in the meeting got notifications, but I recently changed how I was sending the requests and now everyone gets notifications. Before, I would create the meeting request with my personal account, forward it to a service account within the organization that the meeting request is going to, and then from that service account I would forward the meeting request to the all user distribution list. The way I do it now, I am sending the meeting request directly to the all user distribution list from a service account that is not in the recipient organization. 

I think that process is the only thing I changed, the actual meeting settings are the same as before. Unfortunately the email does need to originate from an address outside the recipient organization, so the process I used previously wont work any more.

I would like to be able to apply a device configuration to the phone for items outside of those that can be configured in Teams Admin (Bluetooth on, ringers, volumes, etc). Can this be managed with a device configuration from InTune? We have not yet enabled Android enrollment; I'd just like to know if configuration of the device is possible from InTune.

Can a Teams Phone be directly provisioned to a user so the need to log in is diminished (or reduced to the standard trusted period for a saved login)? Even with device code login, this would be hard to get users to adopt. If we can assign as a trusted device in a trusted network and assign to a user that would be helpful.

We are trying to evaluate/test impact of people (say around 200) using MS Teams from the office building and the rest from home (as it works today). We are mainly concerned that people working from office may get audio/video issues and we want to be proactive and test this setup.

I found couple of resources to test the quality of audio/video call from the office network

\- Using ""Test Call"" option from the MS Teams desktop client

\- Using ""Network Assessment Tool"" from this link ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/3-envision-evaluate-my-environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/3-envision-evaluate-my-environment))

Both of the above approaches actually seem to test single node.

Is there any way by which we can simulate around 200 people connecting to MS Teams?

What if the network assessment tool is executed in parallel two-hundred times from office network, will it be equivalent to 200 people connecting to MS teams at the same time?

Are there any other 3rd party tools available to do this load testing without having to wait for people to actually go to office and report issues (if any).

I'm trying to figure out a way how to disable Automatic Echo Canceling in Teams when supplying teams with an external audio and video feed via VMIX and NDI Tools. As far as I understand it from these posts [here](https://www.svconline.com/news/how-acoustic-echo-cancelling-really-works-370325) and [here](https://www.haraldsteindl.eu/2020/09/acoustic-echo-cancelling-aec-in-ms-teams/) Microsoft only disables AEC when a Teams certified Speaker/ Microphone Combination is connected as Input Source for Audio.   


We're producing shows with Mic's and Inears, so now Echo Cancellation ist required, but other than Zoom for example theres no way to deactivate it. 

Can anyone think of a way around this or does a Teams Certified System with an Audio Input (preferably Pro Audio XLR NDI DANTE) exist where I could input the signal so that Teams doesn't try to suppress Audio where there's nothing to post-process?

Case Study Details:

1. ABCL is a company whose mails are in Gsuit.
2. All people in ABCL has email ids as [john@abcl.com](mailto:john@abcl.com)
3. SoftDrink Co wants ABCL to train its 2500 Officers over MS Team.
4. ABCL purchased 3 MS Team licenses : i) [quicklearn@abcl.com](mailto:quicklearn@abcl.com)

ii) [biglearn@abcl.com](mailto:biglearn@abcl.com)

iii) [john@abcl.com](mailto:john@abcl.com)

5) All the above are in Gsuit for email.

6) To be noted that ‘ABCL’ as a domain has been marked and allowed at Microsoft end before license purchase.

7) Initial Problem faced : Mails were not coming to [john@abcl.com](mailto:john@abcl.com)

How it was resolved ? Microsoft engineer mirrored the email  ID ‘[john@abcl.com](mailto:john@abcl.com)’ to Microsoft exchange server. Now mail services are running. Apparently, they are first going to Microsoft exchange, then coming to Gsuit which as user I am not able to find out.

8) Big Issue Unsolved by Microsoft Engineers over last 2 weeks :

**a)** [**quicklearn@abcl.com**](mailto:quicklearn@abcl.com) **logs into MS Teams. Goes to ‘Schedule Meetings”, inputs various email IDs and sends. The invites do not go to i) anyone ii) sometimes to goes to some but not to others.**

**\[b) It does not show in their Ms Teams Calendars.\]**

b) Especially, to domains like [shelly@yahoo.com](mailto:shelly@yahoo.com), [sean@rustudent.edu.us](mailto:sean@rustudent.edu.us) or even to our own emails which are in Gsuit.

9) MS certified engineers are struggling. They are saying migrate to Microsoft instead of Gmail.

10) We are ABCL feel that this is either a tech-blindness, skill-incompetence or business tactic of MS to force us to migrate to Microsoft

11) What if, we migrate to MS but after that Google Teams or any other platform stops talking to MS exchange.

A few colleagues and I chat on MS Teams and also use OneDrive for our shared folder of files - but we exclusively use it within Windows. No one bothers using the online version.

Can we send a link to a file in Teams chat which will then open the right file location in Windows Explorer? Happy to use a plug in/hack/witchcraft to achieve this!

Thanks for any help, it's doing my head in when people paste C:\User\Colleague Dave\AcmeWare\Docs\Images\widget.jpg in chat and expect me to be able to open it.

2021-07-13 00:11:26,Calendar options/help,"Hi all,

I've really been diving deep into MS teams lately and really enjoying it. The one thing that has always been kind of a big pain in the rear end has been calendars. Calendars in MS in their entirety are kind of a pain anyway but yeha.

Aside from simply showing the OWA portal, is there another affective way to deal with calendars in a channel and have them show (in an organized fashion) in outlook?

Channel calendar works, but there is no month view. And what it does is invite everyone in the channel to an event and that event shows in their personal calendar. I'm building a project management system that will be used for potentially 100s of jobs a year. Each will be their own channel. At any one time there could be 10 projects happening at once. So having them all show up in a personal calendar is kind of a pain.

What I'd like, is to be able to add a tab/app to a channel. That tab/app would associate to a calendar in Outlook thats already built (or build a new one). And it would display/edit events in that selected calendar in real time. In a perfect world, i'd like each channel calendar to be individual and then everything gathers in one selected calendar. Kind of the way channel calendar works now, but being able to select which calendar you want it on.

New user to Teams, moved from Slack.  One main benefit I see that Slack had is in regards to managing large numbers of chats with different people throughout the day.  It seems as if Teams has a Pin functionality (like Slack), but limits this at 15 conversations.  The rest of the conversations end up in a chronological list, mixing group chats, individual chats, and meeting chats - making it very difficult to find someone specific in the list when needed without searching.  

Slack alphabetizes these, making it easy to find a chat or group when needed, and also groups them by type (i.e. group chat/individual DM/etc.).  Is there any way to do this in Teams, or an upcoming enhancement announced by any chance on this front?

Wondering what you or your users are using insofar as wireless earbuds with Teams.

We gave everyone Jabra Evolve 75 MS when we first deployed Teams and they have been rock solid. We use them for video and for all our calling through Teams.

However, I wanted to go with some in ear buds so the headset didn't look as obvious on video (I'm a lawyer and doing a lot of court appearances by video).

So, based on the track record of the Evolve 75, I ordered a the Jabra Evolve 65t MS. Paired them up to my existing Jabra link etc and away I go...

I have to say I've been really disappointed with them. When listening to audio they cut out slightly and I've had nothing but complaints from people saying that I'm dropping out or sounding robotic when I'm on the phone to them.

Is anybody else seeing this? I am seeing the same issues reported on forums going back to January of this year with seemingly MS taking no interest in the problem.

It looks like breakout rooms was a ruched-out and badly tested 'feature' in an attempt to keep up with Zoom during the video-conference 'goldrush' of the pandemic. But it looks to me as MS have short themselves in the foot and don't really care to fix it. Sounds somewhat familiar.

I'm working with a client who is having issues inviting guest users to meetings using the android app.

I have an upcoming interview for a job via Teams. If anyone has any tips that would be much appreciated!

2021-07-21 22:31:36,"Looking for advise on Teams/Channels setup (single, small department)","I'll apologize upfront as this is peanuts compared to some of the massive enterprise setups I see discussed but it's new to me and I am tasked with figuring out an efficient structure.

1 department, 3 functional subgroups, 8 individual people. Some features of our activity:

* Daily huddles and weekly department meetings (all subgroups)
* Weekly subgroup meetings, some cross-departmental and/or include executives
* Hundreds of small ""clients"", handful of primary large ""clients"" so there is a constant stream of minor to medium issues with a variety of ""clients"" to resolve that might only stick around for 1-3 weeks

Currently, we aren't using Teams/Channels but I have made a Department ""Team"" and Channels for each subgroup.

**Specific Questions:**

* If we have departmental level recurring meetings, would it make sense to use the General channel to host those meetings?
** Given that those meetings can touch on each of the subgroups wouldn't any meeting documentation need to be manually re-documented into the respective subgroup channel?
* Managing external users to recurring meetings seems to be a challenge - if we have a recurring weekly subgroup meeting that requires attendance by a bunch of other departmental uses can that even be a channel-based meeting?
* Do you use channel conversations for questions or just status updates?
** If Week 1 an issue with a client is discussed, it persists for a week or two with no resolution and is then brought up again there wouldn't be much of a prompt that a conversation had started a few weeks back on the topic (short of just remembering)

I think I am most struggling with how to envision Channel conversations should be organized, how meeting discussions get incorporated, and how this is separated from group chat (where all of our conversation occurs now).

2021-07-23 11:39:17,Managing customer cadence meetings and content using Teams (coming from Slack/Zoom),"**Summary:**  
In Slack I would just create a channel and invite all of my customer's team members to it, and then pair that with zoom meetings via Google Calendar.

Using Teams, I would like to leverage some of the perks I have seen thus far - such as persistent conversations and embedding meetings/chats into the channels themselves. Also, my customers prefer Teams over Slack.  


**Detailed issue:**

I made a new 'Team' using a Office365 distribution list - let's call it ""Support Team"" - and then I created a channel for each of my customers under that new Team. I then invited my external test emails to those channels and then realized that my test accounts (invited as external Guests) could see the member list and therefore see my other customers. I need to have separation of concerns so that one customer has no idea of my other customers - yet I need my team to have access to all of my customer communication channels without massive overhead. How should I architect this in Teams? Am I supposed to make a 'Team' instead of a channel for each customer communication channel (Example team: ""Support&lt;&gt;CustomerName"" for each customer?)  


**Solution requirements:**

* Data must persist. I often show a demo/workshop and record from teams. I need the participants to maintain access to the chat after the meeting, and maintain access to that recording within the meeting chat. Currently, my attendees (guests) lose access to the chat after they leave the cadence meeting.
* One customer must not know the existence of another. This was the issue I found with using a single team and inviting to a dedicated channel (the slack flow I am familiar with). When I brought my test account into a channel, it added them to the team as a guest, and revealed the member list, etc.
* I need my entire team to have access to each customer's cadence discussions and content, while guests only have access to their respective environment.
* I would like to have all meetings scheduled to automatically be added to a Office365 Group that I have that includes all of my team members. We use it as a shared calendar for everyone's cadence calls to be easily viewable across the team (instead of siloed to someone's individual calendar only)

Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!

I have a user that added a MS Project tab and was able to create a project, add tasks and everything. For some reason once its created, when he navigates to another group and then jumps back to the group where the Project tab is created. It errors out and shows

I have a recurrent teams meeting running under a team of my organisation. The majority of participants in this meeting are guests from outside the organisation and frequently from a wide range different organisations. This form of recurrence allows for using the same meeting link and allow all members of the organisation to record the meeting, which is necessary for our purposes.

The meeting chat, though, seems to be available only for the members of the team, both from my organisation and guest members added from other organisations. Frequent non-member meeting participants sadly seem to be unable to participate in the meeting chat. Is there a way to allow the chat for non-member meeting guests?

2021-07-27 14:39:48,Is Hybrid Migration to Business Teams possible?,"Hi

My company is migrating to Microsoft Business. Most of the migration is relatively straight forward.

We currently use free teams, which was set up before my time so the filing system was not linked to a onedrive or designated sharepoint or the like. So our files are floating through the sharepoint ether (from my understanding)

From my understanding there are two ways we can migrate.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Start from scratch: which is preferred by some team members as the current teams set up is beseiged by duplicate groups and redundant groups etc.
2. Migrate the teams as is: this is preferred by others as they want to take the files with them

Is there a way I can do this in a hybrid way whereby I can save files (maybe conversations) but start the  actual landscape from scratch? I think I can download all the documents onto a hard drive and readd them at a later point but was wondering about the conversations?

&amp;#x200B;

Or should I migrate as is and then clean it up before giving access to the relevant team members making sure files/conversations are moved?

2021-07-27 18:44:08,"SFB Web Meetings App and SFB desktop client missing functionality (video, app share, audio) in SFBOnline meetings in a TeamsOnly environment. Web client says it refuses to load the ActiveX control.","This started about two months ago. We have a tiny handful of people that support external customers who only use SFB to do video sharing/desktop sharing (for security reasons, apparently). No Teams, no Zoom, no Go2Meeting or whatever the kids are calling it these days.

We're told that even with TeamsOnly set, a SFB-Online-style meeting join link should still work, and should either open the web meeting app or a scaled-back SFB desktop client that only functions as a meeting platform (no contact,s no IMs, no phonecalls, just meetings and a calendar).

I do not have any influence over the Enterprise Site List, at least not currently. But I'm not sure even that running Edge in ""IE Mode"" will work, because IE also doesn't to load the web meetings app.

I can sortakindabutnotreally get the desktop client to work if I go into IE and add specific URLs ([https://meet.$domain](https://meet.$domain), where $domain is the domain of the external customer's SFB meeting host, plus a few others like [browse.aria.lync.net](https://browse.aria.lync.net)) to the trusted sites pane in IE settings -&gt; Security.  I fished these URLs out of a Fiddler trace of lync.exe and the web app processes.

To get this to work, I have to uninstall and reinstall skypemeetingsapp.msi, then paste the meeting url into IE's location bar, and then tell it to load the desktop client. It takes a while, but eventually joins the meeting and has app sharing, video, audio and IM features. That works for some users affected by this, but not everyone. And even though there is a growing number of people affected by this, there are lots of people who are not -- they enter web meetings without any errors.

Any thoughts, ideas? One of our systems engineers says that ""ActiveX may be out of date"" -- but I can't for the life of me find anything on how to cause activeX to get updated. I'm not even sure that ActiveX enters into the picture when using the Desktop client.

This happens to brand new PCs with the latest Windows image from IT, and to older Windows installs. It also DOESN'T happen on new PCs with the latest image. It seems to be user specific.

I'm leaning towards this being an issue at the external customer's end, but until that's confirmed I have to treat it as something we're doing, or the user is doing. though I do not support any of these  external customers, my PC is also affected by this. None of my teammates are.

2021-07-28 00:24:35,Ongoing support call via MS Teams?,"Hi everyone.        
I'm currently in a support and training role and my team make ourselves available via a skype meeting that runs every day.       
Two of us or more sit in the meeting all day and if our users need help with the software that we train/support then they just need to click the skype link and they can speak to us directly.         
           
This has been useful as this is an ongoing project and it allows us to sit outside of the general IT support structure. 1st line etc have not been handed over any of this responsibility as it's a clinical app and we sit inside the clinical app support structure (2nd line I suppose) the nature of the app means that users need real-time support and training.          
           
We've publicised the link to the meeting in various places around our organisation. We'd have to replace all of these links when the time comes.         
This has been quite a useful service during Covid as our users aren't office based but they do have laptops and it's meant that they can all get real-time support with no triage necessary.       
            
As an organisation we are moving over to MS Teams so we need to replace the Skype meeting with an equivalent method.           
            
An ideal solution for us would be an ongoing meeting (presumably) with a static meeting ID with a shareable link that a user can click on to immediately connect to one of our team.             
Ideally when the user clicks the link it ""calls"" one of us in a hunt group style. If A doesn't answer, then call B, if B doesn't answer then call C etc.           
          
I'm not involved whatsoever in the MS Teams deployment and I want to be able to request a tangible set-up for this solution instead of approaching the MS Teams deployment team with a vague request.             

Can any of you please suggest a solution for what we are trying to provide?

I'm currently doing an IT co-op at a local business. Recently, we started moving people over to MS Teams instead of Zoom. Everyone so far has been able to get setup without any problems, except two people so far. I expect more people to have this issue as more people are moved over to Teams.

If the problem persists, please contact your support team.""

I'm looking for some advice on the best way to handle using microsoft teams meeting in meeting/conference rooms.

our conference rooms have dedicated PC's in them, and not every employee has a laptop so some need a way to run a meeting from the room.

Currently, we are logging in to the room PC's teams app with user credentials, but this is very clunky and often results in people leaving their account logged in.

2021-07-28 22:33:28,Why I don't use Teams,"Vent on why I don't voluntarily use Teams:  I attempted to join a Microsoft teams meeting five minutes before a meeting with a municipality that my client attended in person.  The app was already downloaded on my Mac and I’ve used it in small meetings.  I was first required to download an update before I could join the meeting.  The download was slow so I elected the option to join the meeting in the browser.  Nothing happened when I elected that option so I went back to install the download.  My password did not automatically load from saved passwords so I requested a code from Teams to log in.  After entering the code, nothing happened.  Finally, I reset the password.  The app required two more code requests before it let me open it.  Once opened, I had to go back to the email with the meeting link to join the meeting.  As a result, I was 11 minutes late to the meeting and missed the introduction to the city team in which I was supposed to participate.

Further, unlike in Zoom meetings I regularly attend, I was unable to adjust the view to see the speaker view featured over other gallery participants.  I could only see the screenshare featured prominently.  On Zoom, you can select speaker view as the featured view.  At this meeting, at least 14 people were meeting in person to discuss plans on a conference room table.  I could not see them any larger than the views of members of the public attending the meeting virtually.  I had to request that the city turn off screenshare so that I could participate appropriately in the meeting.

Towards the end of the meeting, someone in the city changed the view so that the view of the conference room was again the same size as the public view so I got to see the nostrils of elderly townspeople.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/otb4b2/why_i_dont_use_teams/,Ananams

If I transfer a call to the mobile number listed for another user the transfer appears fine from my end but the caller hears an error message ""You're not setup to use this calling feature.

I dont use it for communication or anything but it runs in the background and shows whether im active or not.

Someone said to put a paperclip next to a key on the keyboard to stay active but someone said your “log” will then show that you did that. If i dont even use teams and it just runs in the background, do i even have a “log” to worry about? I was just wondering what activity teams monitors exactly?

In my ideal scenario there would be a single team which would have each client as a different channel however thinking about this means all the clients would need to be added to the business consulting team (visible to each other) before being added to the channel.

When I call a queue from the PSTN I get 2-3 normal “rings” before the queue music begins. I then get about 2-3 seconds of queue music before the agent phones ring so all up about 5 or so seconds before a call can even be answered. Internally most people give up by this time.

2021-08-04 04:07:13,[BOT BUILDING] How do I wait for user input?,"I'm currently writing a bot with node.js and botframework that will handle user's suport tickets. I want to query them for a few infos, but the only thing I've managed so far was to have my first input being used to all the functions. The constructor looks like this:

    constructor() {
            super();
    
            this.onMessage(async (context, next) =&gt; {
                TurnContext.removeRecipientMention(context.activity);
    
                const text = context.activity.text.trim().toLocaleLowerCase();
                if (text.includes(""chamado"")) {
                    await this.openSuportTicket(context);
                }
    
                await next();
            });
        }

And then it calls the following function which starts the suport ticket opening:

        async openSuportTicket(context) {
            const member = await TeamsInfo.getMember(
                context,
                context.activity.from.id
            );
            const replyActivity = MessageFactory.text(
                `Hello ${member.name}! Please describe your problem`
            );
            await context.sendActivity(replyActivity);
    
            await this.getTicketInfos(context);
        }

But I don't know how to wait for the user reply. The context ends up being the same for the whole chat, which starts and ends immediately as a result. As you can see, sending messages to the user is no problem so far, but I haven't been able to process anything but the very first input.

2021-08-05 05:34:46,Compatible touch-enabled displays for Teams Rooms?,"Hi all,

My company is looking into MTR devices for some of our conference rooms, and one use case we'd really like to have is interactive touch-enabled displays, mostly for use with the Whiteboard application within Teams. It's very compelling to enable in-person staff to draw directly on a screen that remote staff can also interact with!

Most of my staff are non-technical, so ease of use that is most similar to low-tech solutions (like actual physical whiteboards) is highly desirable. Content cameras pointing at real whiteboards would be an ok backup plan, but that may result in remote staff feeling like second class citizens.

I'm aware that the Surface Hub 2S devices would work for this, but they are well outside of our price range for most of our non-boardrooms.

I've found very few other ""certified"" compatible displays, though, especially any that are more budget friendly.

Is there a list of such compatible displays anywhere that I've just missed in my googling? Or can anyone recommend any that you've had success with? Or perhaps is there a way upgrade existing displays to be touch-enabled?

2021-08-09 21:44:09,Teams Rooms Devices with external Meeting Providers,"Hey everyone,

my company is growing and opening up a new office. For the new Meeting Rooms (and following the old ones as well i suppose) we want to set up Teams Rooms Devices, especially Lenovo ThinkSmart Hubs. Problem now is that we also use GoTo Meeting and Google Hangouts with some customers, services not supported by Teams Rooms.  
Now I've stumbled across the logitech SWYTCH which would solve our issue but just for a dongle its pretty expensive.   
Does anyone know of a cheaper or even better alternative? Or maybe even a way to enable any Meeting on the device (except Zoom and WebEx, those are pretty easy)?

2021-08-10 00:39:19,Deleting SharePoint Folder after channel deleted,"This one is driving me bananas, curious whether anyone else has run into this. 

Last week, we had a user submit a ticket because they couldn't delete a folder from SharePoint. That folder had once been a Teams channel. 

It's not something I've ever looked into before, but was surprised to learn that [this is intentional](https://office365itpros.com/2019/04/02/deleting-teams-channel-sharepoint-folder/). This is actually good to know, in case it ever happens again. 

So, according to the article I linked above, this *should* be possible 21 days after a channel has been deleted. Again, this makes sense. The issue here is that the channel was deleted months ago, and is currently empty. 

To complicate matters, I also learned that the team owner decided it would be a good idea to break permission inheritance because he didn't want his team members to have edit rights on the files.

To make a long story short, I've walked through the best practices with the team owner, and restored inheritance on the doc library. So we're all good there. But the issue persists. Even I, as an SCA don't have the delete option on that folder. I (and they) can delete other folders that were once channels, but there are a couple where delete isn't even an option. 

I'm certain I can move the folder elsewhere, then delete it, but I'd really love to know why this won't work when everything tells me I should be able to delete it now.

&amp;#x200B;

Having massive problems with a site where people cannot IM or direct Teams call other people in other organisations.  They can IM and call within their own organisation fine.  They were on an Islands configuration despite not using Skype for Business.  

&amp;#x200B;

External access is configured with within Teams and you can also see that no domains are defined.  Everything I've read tells me that means this organisation can therefore communicate with any domain.

They are definitely on Teams only mode.

&amp;#x200B;

I have checked the co-existence mode on some users - it says Teams only.

I have also checked on the Powershell config to ensure that AllKnownDomains is there - it is!

2021-08-10 16:19:13,Is Teams a secure platform to transmit passwords?,"Hi all,

For context, my background is in Service Desk Support and now Service Design and Delivery.

In previous positions, it's always been best practice to transmit passwords to users directly, ideally over the phone (desk phone or company mobile) or via SMS, or even to the manager for them to pass down.

The idea was never to write down the password anywhere that is a likely attack vector i.e email or on a SD ticket.

However, now that most users are on Teams, should we be using Teams to send passwords?

By passwords, I'm referring to password resets, so only ever temporary passwords which should be reset upon first login. Obviously shared service passwords should be stored in a password manager.

What are people's thoughts on sending passwords over Teams? Secure? Not so much? Is strong 2FA the answer? Interested in how other people are standardising this.",1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/p1kzgs/is_teams_a_secure_platform_to_transmit_passwords/,delboydel1

2021-08-10 18:28:01,Can my teacher be using a software to detect background activity in my device during online class?," 

Some context: My teachers are all lagging behind in school, and I have covered several chapters before them. I have long duration online classes and I don't want to spend hours going through the topics I have already covered. So during this time I either read articles online with the meeting running in background, or I scroll Reddit or I search up some NSFW stuff too. My meetings take place on MS Teams.

Our school has a website of its own with recorded lectures (just like Khan Academy) and when a student is using the website and attending the meetings at the same time, the teachers know.

They even showed us a chart with the names of students doing this. I guess they detect IP addresses to do this, but I'm not sure.

What my main concern is, can they be tracking what is going on in my screen at all times? I'll be totally fucked if they can.

1. Some details (might be useful, might be not, idk):
2. I use my own personal PC for my classes.
3. The school has provided each student with a personal Microsoft ID and they know the passwords.
4. My head teacher has MS Excel opened at all times. The site usage detecting chart was in Excel.
5. He also has a weird looking app with a scissor as the icon. I have no idea what that app's purpose is. I can share it's picture if anyone thinks this might be important.

So that was it, I will be very, very grateful if anyone could provide some insight into my concern.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/p1mhq8/can_my_teacher_be_using_a_software_to_detect/,reddittimepass2

Want to manage some settings to this account (as change email address so it looks a bit more formal to those I am interviewed by): NAHA MATE (/W()""% OFF!

2021-08-13 03:14:08,Teams should be the centerpiece to Microsoft 365. Why isn't it?,"I'd like to start this post by saying that this is meant to be an honest discussion into why Teams has so much potential yet struggles at some basic things. I have a lot of respect for the developers, especially having to get Teams into a working state for COVID, and this is no way a jab at them. I think it was just a bummer situation where the developers didn't have enough time to think things out as well as they had hoped, especially with the time crunch of COVID. Kudos to all of you.

I am a software engineer at an engineering and manufacturing company and we use Microsoft Teams and the Microsoft enterprise suite. Teams is okay, but there are really backwards ways of doing things, and some quality of life things that could be improved. For instance, the meeting scheduler and calendars between Teams and Outlook should, in my opinion, work and look exactly the same. Or better yet, create a ""Calendar app"" that both Teams and Outlook share. By doing this, the developers could create an app that integrates the best parts of both the Teams calendar and the Outlook calendar between the two apps and it would be so much easier than having to decide between either the Teams calendar or the Outlook calendar. Scheduling out of office and status messages is always a pain in the ass. A feature within the scheduler or calendar should be available to set a custom status message to appear during an appointment or event automatically. That would be substantially more productive than trying to time your status message just right. Not to mention, it doesn't seem like the process of setting a status message was well-thought out at all. Also, having the ability to customize your chats' colors would be really helpful. That purple isn't the most attractive color. 

There have been countless bugs with the software as well. The fact that it is built on Electron, which uses Chromium, explains the resource hogging, but thats not a huge issue in my opinion. The real issues are things like entire group chat histories disappearing for weird reasons, and only being visible after you are removed and then replaced to the chat. The file sharing is cool, and the fact that you can open an instance of Word or Excel within Teams and live edit with colleagues is also really cool, but that all needs to have a smoother experience. It can get pretty choppy, especially with large files. They also need to make notifications more intuitive by providing more customizable options. The activity panel is stupid in a lot of ways. I wish they weren't trying so hard to add features that you would find on something like a social media site. 

All in all, Teams has improved an astronomical amount since COVID started. It used to be incredibly buggy, and now it runs *relatively* well. I feel like there are so many things to be improved with the GUI and I only touched on a few of my gripes, but overall there is still so much potential that the app has. Microsoft is already an enterprise software powerhouse. They have really great programs and have made a name for themselves in terms of the quality and usability of their software. But they need to make Teams a priority and just overhaul a lot of the poorly thought out and rushed designs, and actually sit down and study how customers used their app and what features they find useful. Bring in the use case diagrams and plan the app out. Don't add bullshit useless features that are going to die at some point anyway because no one ends up using them. Build the software correctly now that the pandemic is winding down and you don't have to rush the feature roll out anymore. Microsoft should make Teams a priority, because with the right planning and designs, Teams could absolutely evolve to be the beautiful centerpiece to an already matured and robust suite of enterprise software applications. Oh, and as a software developer myself, it would be badass to see some cross-compatibility with visual studio/visual studio code. 

Also, any explanations, or reasons as to why things work the way they do, or other things people want to bring up in general are welcomed and encouraged!

2021-08-14 06:49:06,Whiteboard Within Teams,"Anyone here use Whiteboard  Within Teams? Looks like reviews say Whiteboard   is laggy and buggy.

What's max zoom out on this?

Trying to make my design in various apps. Here's Examples of Good UI in Graphics Apps

Tested some graphics apps, results:

**Good:**

Clover app

* Very clean UI
* Since is new, seems to have 0 functions
* Doesn't seem to have colors or I can't find it.
* Tested [https://app.cloverapp.com/hipida1070/page/Untitled--dd7a8c66-bf97-4ca9-8633-d4cc051c38e3](https://app.cloverapp.com/hipida1070/page/Untitled--dd7a8c66-bf97-4ca9-8633-d4cc051c38e3)

Whiteboard without signin

* Simple, easy, much more limited than above
* [https://witeboard.com/db6043b0-faf6-11eb-ad89-e14f4eb1a802](https://witeboard.com/db6043b0-faf6-11eb-ad89-e14f4eb1a802)

&amp;#x200B;

**Usable:**

* You can have background fill/colors on the shapes, but I prefer a kind of gradient like from one color to another color
* I prefer this, but don't need this. I think that may be too advanced for this
* UI was kinda cluttered. UI used really weird words, but not as weird as Canva's UI.
* [https://app.mural.co/t/name5392/m/name5392/1628726483770/dba7ec32b4b84bbc2bc96fcb3398a57e42d5fac4?sender=u70f81e95061f5ce784983886](https://app.mural.co/t/name5392/m/name5392/1628726483770/dba7ec32b4b84bbc2bc96fcb3398a57e42d5fac4?sender=u70f81e95061f5ce784983886)

&amp;#x200B;

**Examples of bad UI is:**

* FigJam, no idea how to even use this, so confusing [https://www.figma.com/figjam/](https://www.figma.com/figjam/)

I'm sure there's examples of much more bad UI, but still testing

Tested Canva again, and that was definitely the worst one. It's good if you want to make something based on templates. But if you want to make anything using a good tool, Canva is not good. It's for people that want to make generic things -- based on templates. It's kinda like designing based on a conveyer belt. That's how it feels.

That's not what designing is suppose to be about. It's not suppose to be about the corporation or marketing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Things cant test**

* Cant test or download this one, some error [https://fiftythree.com/think](https://fiftythree.com/think)
* Think this mainly for mind-mapping, already tested a bit in past for something else [https://miro.com/](https://miro.com/)
* Some sites went dead, maybe went bankrupt, who knows
* Some were for mobile
* Some were just so confusing
* A few seem like maybe it was paid, who knows, those sites were a mess. The people that founded those companies likely outsourced everything.

&amp;#x200B;

The most popular of the above is likely Miro, but I think that it's for specific uses.

Last to check is Microsoft whiteboard. Another time. Big tech usually makes much better tools than small companies, but not always.

Small companies sometimes make good tool if they have really talented people in them. This is much more rare.

&amp;#x200B;

Went to look for whiteboarding apps on a site that most people don't know. This was the goal.

**Goal:** I want to create a simple graphics just by dragdrop or drawing

Tried again to do this in Canva but canva is very hard to learn. It also has a really bad UI. It also has zero users, or at least none of them are active. The forums for this tool is all dead.

Someone said that adobe illustrator is not easy to use. A few said this, and said that it does complex thins that I likely won't need

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:** What other graphics tools  have you used recently that I should look into?

(I think within 1 year is probably good, things sometimes... get updated significantly within a year.

Is there anyone here that has used  other options recently?

Which options should I look into that are easier than inkscape?

&amp;#x200B;

**Problems:** Someone also said all ""vector"" graphics tools are poorly designed.  I don't what things are ""vector"" graphics and what things are not since the tools don't said.

It's also really hard to see what things are good and are not since there's reviews or comparisons anywhere like there are for games.

I don't know if there is because graphics tools have extremely few users or if games have many more players.

What are the non-vector graphics tool I should look into? Or what is a good vectors graphics tool I should look into?

&amp;#x200B;

**More Problems:** There also seems to be very very few graphics tool  that can create a simple graphics. And a good one may not be easy to find.

We've gotten used to the idea of not having walk ins etc so are looking at options for access control or a front door bell system.

2021-08-16 14:13:55,"Worst experience with any video conference software I've ever used. (Sorry, rant)","I'm trying to get MS Teams installed for someone to use in a job interview. I expected to have to set up an account, maybe update a driver. It sucks running into problems right at the start of an interview, so I wanted to make sure it ran smoothly on this machine.

What I didn't expect was for Microsoft to try to hijack the local system account instead of allowing us to log into her account. Had to set up a new Microsoft account, but it wouldn't give us the option to do that in the sign up process.  We had to go to [outlook.com](https://outlook.com) to set one up. Then when we went back to sign up for teams it claimed that email was already in use and still tried to use the system account. Finally tried to sign in using the account we just created and it worked. So apparently the ""create a new account"" path is completely broken.

Because it kept trying to use my account I tried using an incognito tab. It couldn't use an incognito tab because the app didn't have permission to run, fine. I finally got it to launch using a new Chrome profile.

There wasn't an obvious way to download the client when we finally got it logged in, so we tried to start a meeting in the browser. The inbound video froze after a few frames.

So I found the client, installed it. Again fought to use an account other than the system account. It asked for a PIN number for HER account, but accepted the system PIN (WTF!!!!!!!!), then finally seemed to work except, video still freezes after a few seconds.

I disabled GPU acceleration and manually cleared Team's cache, that didn't help. Updating video drivers now, but I refuse to spin up a new system account for one f\*ing app.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand how one of the most powerful and wealthy corporations in the world A: Produced such a pile of garbage, and B: Somehow released it to the world as if it was a functioning piece of software!

I \*do\* understand why a number of companies and organizations use it, there's just as many MS fanboys as there are Apple fanboys that will eat whatever the corp shoves down their throat. But this is pitiful. There are so many options that work so much better. I thought I had seen issues in those other apps, but now I see that MS has set the bar so low those other apps are towering beacons of achievement.

This has been accelerating over the past few months and I have had to learn it myself.  Question is why:

1. Aggressive Marketing by Microsoft.  -  Promise to save Companies $.  One IT Solution as opposed to dealing with several vendors.
2. Increased Transparency into Employee Performance.  - Really hate to go here but are the days of telling your boss, ""We are working on scheduling a call (with a coworker) but it hasn't happened yet over?""  Will your Boss be able to say ""I dont see any calls in Teams?""
3. What exact distillation of data can Supervisors see of Employees performance in Teams.  I think the future desire is that all internal activity in an Enterprise occur in Teams, not E-Mail, not over the phone, not through Speed Memo's or Mimeographs.

 I'm trying to work out how to access the developer preview of MS Teams on MacOS.

 I am not in an organization that uses teams -- but rather I join the odd call where the org uses teams. I also did encounter teams briefly on windows 11.  


The docs for enabling access talk about the admin center, but as a single user there is no admin as such? If I open up teams &amp; login with either of my MS accounts I cannot see any option to access the developer preview under, for example, the drop down menu from profile picture.

2021-08-18 03:25:59,Teams is confusing. (i.e. Why can't I copy/paste a file?),"I've been using teams the past couple years at work.

For instance, I can't copy/paste a file into a chat, but yet it will let me drag/drop the same file just fine. 

The other issue I've found is that pressing enter while typing a message posts it. You normally have to hold shift + enter to enter a return to get to a new line. . . . except if you create an auto formatting list in the post. I discovered today that if you start a list with 1., type some stuff and press enter, it inserts 2. for your autoformatted list. While in the list, enter behaves differently than if there were none.

2021-08-18 09:12:06,Warning to those considering Teams Voice for company phone system.,"I just thought i’d share my experience here and maybe vent a little, late last year we were talked into migrating to Teams Voice for our company wide phone system from our Shoretel/Mitel system.

I admit i was kind of excited, and i thought that i generally like Microsoft products and have had great experience with Teams for video conferencing.   We are a company with around 400 staff and 20 different locations.

Here are my warnings, its been my experience, that using a Team desk phone is an awful experience.   We have numerous issues with users not being able to sign in, or the phone gets stuck on the company portal screen, delays in audio, delays with calls connecting, volume to low on phones, and much more, like the phons not ringing or ringing after even 10 seconds after its answered!

Just picking up a phone and saying hello, the most basic function of a desk phone, is hit or miss.   I feel like a lot of these issues have to do with call queues, its just not ready for prime time.   I wish that i had known that.

The desk phone interface is clunky, its not easy to transfer a call, and the phones needed to update before they had the option to transfer to voicemail…. 
All of our phones have a Teams button, and I have no idea what its for… it just take you back to the home screen, pretty useless.

Number porting woes… we have several somewhat rural branches, and we were under the impression that we could port those numbers to Teams, only to find out at the last minute that they are in an unsupported area and they cannot port.   This has cause lot of issues and takes numerous rings, trying to forward phone number to the Teams Voice Cloud.   Customers would potentially be upset if we were to disconnect the local number and publish the new teams number.

When we started programming it became clear very quickly that Teams voice doesn’t have all the features that even our Shoretel System had.   When it came to call queue and auto attendants its, completely unintuitive.   I’ve stumbled though it, but you end up creating multiple “auto attendants” to create a basic call flow, with an after hour menu, call queue and on hours menu.  (3 AA and 1 CQ per location) yikes.

People complain a lot about their cell phone app ringing along with there deskphone and pc…. there is not way to turn off one or the other, without signing out, that i’m aware of.
 
The good things….  I think people who use a wired headset have great experiences, except they hate the wired headset, and i have to remind them, that the handset was always attached to the phone.   Honestly, i’d like to hear a list of good things from others because i can’t think of much.   Maybe if we were to ever be able to cut ties with the phone companies that would be a plus, but as it sits, thats not the case.

Thanks for reading.    Open to tips and advice, hoping that some of this gets fixed by updates overtime.

Ultimately, I wish that someone would have warned me, if you need to use desk phones and call queues then Teams Voice isn’t and option.",1.0,1.0,1.0,61.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/p6gych/warning_to_those_considering_teams_voice_for/,meintsd

They seem pretty set on wanting physical phone sets. They are looking at the Yealink MP54 - but I've seen a lot of mixed reviews.

It's not strange that it's a corporate/business software, but how the hell does a regular user try this software? 

I cannot login for the love of me. If I am not part of an organization, is it possible to login? I have tried on two separate accounts and on two separate laptops. 

The only way I got to try teams is through an invite link from someone whose work provides it for them. I find it very very strange that it's pretty much impossible to try out the client for yourself.

2021-08-20 22:09:24,DR Derived trunks and changes upstream?,"Hey Everyone, hope your Friday is going swell!

I am wondering a couple things. We have a DR setup, and use derived trunks. I haven't touched it in what feels like more than a year, just added new tenants. In short, I've forgotten so many things.

So first question, will adding a phone system license to an admin on the SBC account cause anything weird, like settings to get wiped? Odd and improbable question, I know, but I obviously cant do anything that will jeopardize the config. I have not seen anything cautioning me against or advocating I do this, but my buddy just said it must not be touched, which I think is insane. Best to be sure, though! At this point I only want to view Dialplans, Voice Routes, and Voice Routing Policies that I cannot see from the customer tenants and see if that is where my issues are.

Second,  Assuming I can go in there, see and change some of these objects, do those changes flitter down to the derived trunks for Customer Tenants automatically? Otherwise, will I need to re-add them to the tenants, sync them somehow, or take some additional action? This will be our first ""edit"" of things besides moving to derived trunks.

Third, is there a way to list all of the Customer Tenants?

Bonus Completely Unrelated Question: I have a doc that says that AAD is unsupported with Teams DR, but bits and bobs from here and there which looks like it might be possible -  A doc from sonus backs this up, and MS own doc that looks to convert to a hybrid environment is provided as a first step, but no other guidance. If I get the gist, it says set it up but do all the setup on prem and use a ""tool"" to sync it to AAD. Even though MS says it is an unsupported configuration, has anyone pulled it off? Any pitfalls or tips?

2021-08-23 17:01:27,MS Teams - Audio &amp; Microphone Issues,"Hi all,

I'm hoping someone can perhaps point out something I've missed when trying to troubleshoot Teams audio issues.

I'm using the application for work and have only just had it installed on my personal PC. I joined a meeting and I have no audio  - input or output - via my G35 Logitech Headset. I can receive audio and use the microphone in EVERY other application - Google, Discord, Skype etc.

I've set the device in Teams to the G35 both for incoming and outgoing audio.

On a test call I can hear the test lady speaking but when she asks me to record a message that will be replayed to me it doesn't pick it up. 

The fact the test call lady is audible but not real people is weird?

I'm also not able to make an outgoing audio call - the icon is greyed out.

I've reinstalled Teams and the G35 software (but I think the G35 is fine anyway as I said it works in literally anything else).

Are there any common fixes for Teams audio issues please?

Much appreciated. :)",1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/p9vwt8/ms_teams_audio_microphone_issues/,RS_Phil

&amp;nbsp;

We recently migrated several users from Shoretel phones to Teams. Yesterday, one of those users submitted a report that *sometimes*, when dialing a number in teams (say: 850) it will sometimes jumble up (805).

&amp;nbsp;

My first thought is either the keyboard, or the user himself. However, he can type out large strings of numbers/letters in other programs just fine (precise part numbers) and it's only **sometimes** in Teams that it misbehaves in this way.

&amp;nbsp;

Has anyone heard of this? In the meantime I've got him using the on-screen dialer and he's interested in leveraging Contacts to help alleviate this. I've suggested that he try an alternate keyboard to see if it has the same issue but he's been resistant.

We are demoing some Plantronics/Poly Savi 82XX series devices and we've noticed that they continually try and change the Windows volume to whatever the headset is configured for.

For example, in a Teams call I have the volume at 60. Then I switch to my built in speaker and set it to 35. Seconds later, the headset sets my volume back to 60. Additionally, every time I undock the headset, it ensures the volume is set to 60 even though it already is, bringing up the Win10 volume notification in the top left.

After I create the Live Event, I take the attendee link and create an organization-wide calendar invite for the time of the Live Event that includes that link. I do not schedule this second event in the Teams app, since I don't want it to be a Teams Meeting; I've scheduled it in both the OWA and desktop app versions of the Outlook calendar, and I make VERY sure that the option to make it a Teams Meeting is not checked so that I can make sure people show up as attendees to the Live Event and not in a separate Teams Meeting. 

HOWEVER, they end up in a separate Teams Meeting, every time. This latest event, I scheduled the audience-link event in Outlook desktop app, made sure I didn't make it a Teams Meeting, checked the invite regularly for weeks to make sure it was not one, checked 15 minutes before the event and confirmed this had no ""Join"" Teams Meeting button on it..... and then ten minutes into the event, I'm getting bombarded with messages from 100+ people who are in a Teams meeting and not seeing anything, and the event has a ""Join"" button on the Teams calendar and on the invitation in the Outlook inbox. 

How can I make sure Teams is not turning non-Teams events into Teams Meetings without my input?

Now he's going on holiday and due to an unfortunate circumstance his colleague has to work (temporarily) on his computer since specialized printers are only available on his pc/profile and cannot be installed on other computers/users due to licensing.  


In short she can log in with his username and password and thus has access to everything office 365 related including teams via the web browser or locally.

As a test, I sent a MS Teams invite from MyAccount1 configured on my cell phone to MyAccount2 configured on my laptop.  For this test, I configured the following custom setup on my laptop:

* I selected my Logitech C922 Pro Stream webcam as my camera
* I selected ""Synaptics SmartAudio HD"" (the speakers installed in my laptop) as my audio output 

The configuration above worked as expected for my test meeting.  However, when I needed to join a real client meeting today my options were more limited.  I wasn't able to use my external webcam or laptop speakers that I was able to use in my test meeting.  I can't remember for sure if those options were no longer available in the dropdowns of my Teams meeting custom configuration or if those options were there but simply wouldn't activate.  I ended up having to use the webcam built into my laptop (noticably inferior) with a previously connected external BT speaker for audio output.

In addition, in my test meeting, I had over 20 different background options available to me, whereas when I connected to my client meeting today, I think I only had the full background blur option available to me (and maybe one additional very basic option).  I tried another test meeting and confirmed that these background options are available for selection in Teams whether I'm using the external webcam or built in webcam.

2021-08-30 23:41:57,Question about Microsoft Teams Panels | Yealink RoomPanel,"Hi all,

Today I got 4 of my ordered Yealink RoomPanels to be used near meeting rooms (without Teams hardware).

&amp;#x200B;

I set them up and all is working fine, but I was wondering if anybody else got some hand-on experience with these devices.

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't understand is:

&amp;#x200B;

\- why you cannot plan an meeting in the future from the display itself? Only possibility is to plan it ad-hoc until a next planned meeting, and not after a planned meeting.

\- Is there no possibility to check-in the meeting if it is planned? If you planned a meeting, it wil just be set on reserved when the time is there, and then nobody can use it if the organizer does not show up.

\- Little to no information is to be found a this moment, but I found the Setup-Guide of the Yealink on there support page and the manual says it has a function to check in which you can setup brought the App Panel setting on the device. I don't have the option, but I found some screen shots that the new version has that possibility. Until now I can't update the device to the new version, it just says it has the latest version.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope somebody has any experience with it and can maybe clarify some things.

2021-09-01 02:40:22,Having a hard time transitioning from Google Meets to MS Teams. Could someone with Google Meets experience answer questions I have about audio and layouts in Teams?,"I switched jobs three weeks ago. My old job used all Google suite products (gmail, Google drive, Google docs, Google chat, Google meets, etc). I was really comfortable with the Google products and found it to be simple and intuitive. 

My new job uses Teams and Outlook and it has been challenging for me to transition. I’m missing certain features that Google Meets had with layout and audio. 

Google Meets had really nice meeting layout features. One thing I really liked was the ability to automatically spotlight the active speaker. So participant videos would be on the top or side and a larger window would show the active speaker. And it would change automatically. 

I’m missing this feature a lot in Teams and it doesn’t seem to exist. It’s really hard to distinguish who is actively speaking when you have 30+ participants and they’re all small tiles across your meeting screen. You kind of have to rely on everyone to know to turn on and off their video when they are/aren’t presenting. This is frustrating because you’re looking down at the tiny video boxes so your eyes can’t stay to the top of your application window near your camera. 

I noticed there are options to spotlight or pin people but haven’t used them because I’m nervous it changes the layout for everyone and I’d be sabotaging the meeting. Could someone explain how these work? Do only I see it? Are others notified that I do it?

Lastly, does the option to switch computer audio to phone exist? I googled it and it does seem to but looks like my administrator has to approve it and it must be blocked because I don’t see it as an option. That kind of sucks if it’s true because that was a super useful feature in Meets if I needed to step away from my computer for a few mins and didn’t want to miss the discussion. 

Any tips to facilitate the transition? Any features Teams has that Meets doesn’t that May be useful to know?",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/pfc06w/having_a_hard_time_transitioning_from_google/,Dysmal_Cientist

2021-09-02 20:53:12,"Lil story about additional security verification (ASV), web app","Hello. I got access from an organization letting me conduct online teaching through Teams. Let's call this account XXXX.

I have the desktop app and I signed in just fine with their given username and PW the first time. I have also scheduled weekly recurring meetings for this full semester.

It stayed signed in until two days later (about now), so when I opened Teams from desktop, I was immediately in. Then I wanted to make a change. I was looking for a way to enable waiting room like Zoom (lobby?) in the meetings I scheduled. I opened Calendar and clicked the first meeting to check whether there is such option. It turned out that I needed to click Meeting Options, which brought me to my browser. Then, it showed ""Your accound YYYY does not have permissions to make changes."" Note that this YYYY is my personal account, which is different from XXXX. I was confused, so I tried logging in the Teams web app. Perhaps it would be fine accessing Meeting Options via web. But again, the same message appeared. I googled and got suggested to logout of both accounts XXXX and YYYY first and try clearing cache. I then realized my YYYY account was still open on another tab, so perhaps that's the cause, and I followed the suggestion to clear cache too.

Once done, I tried signing in again both via desktop and web. Web is fine, but this ASV page appears on desktop. I do not know what to do, and neither does the person giving me the access as he is also surprised because he saw me logged in the 1st time just fine. He may have to ask his boss for the phone number and stuff to help me get through this ASV page.

Q1. I wonder what happened and how to fix this (other than completing the ASV page) to return like I did the first time, just logging in no problem?

Q2. Suppose that I can no longer access the desktop version (with the XXXX account), so that web is my only option (although I can and will also sign in using ipad for teaching, but doesn't it lack more features?). My question is: What will I not be able to do in web version?

There's also Canada East which is Montreal for Azure, so just wondering if it matters or how to tell if I should use Canada Central or Canada East.  My calls sound fine, but if this is showing Microsoft to the SBC and they are in the same DC or region then I'd expect it to be under 10ms is all.

2021-09-05 21:44:04,"Need help with dial plan with direct routing, *8 before a number fails every time, how can I make this work?","We use direct routing connected to 3CX.  On 3CX directly, I have outbound routes set so that a user can do things like dial \*8 before a number which then uses a different outbound route to change the caller ID and so on.  This works fine on 3CX, but with Teams, if I dial \*8 before a number the call fails every single time.

A few weeks ago I did a trial of a company called Call2Teams which is a SBC that integrates PBX's like 3CX and MS Teams.  This worked great, and I could dial \*8 from Teams before a number and it worked fine.  We then realized that 3CX supports direct routing out of the box, so I cancelled Call2Teams and set it up with 3CX directly, but there is where I can't get it to work.  I'm thinking it might have something to do with the dial plans, but I tried changing them to match what Call2Teams was before but same issue.

Above you can see on the call log me calling TD Bank and it clearly shows the correct number on the log, with \*8 before the 18662223456 but it fails every time.  It doesn't even make it to the SBC and 3CX doesn't even have any reference of a call being attempted.  If I remove the \*8 then it works fine.  If I open the 3CX softphone or use an IP Phone and dial \*818662223456 it works every time.

If I set 3CX outbound route to look for the prefix ""1866"" and call this number normally, it uses this route as expected.  But for whatever reason if I use a \* or # it never works.  But it 100% did when using Call2Teams, so I think it has to be some setting in Teams admin but not sure what to check!",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/pidcbc/need_help_with_dial_plan_with_direct_routing_8/,psykobunnyto

I'm having issues with call queue calls to iPhones. We have a temperamental issue to a couple of iPhones in a call queue, that when receiving calls, the calls will ring for less than a second and then cut out and then ring for less than a second and then cut out. The recipient cannot pick up the calls as it's too quick. I've tried on my iPhone too and it's the same experience. From the experience of the caller, it will just be one call, it's only the recipient that has repetitive calls cutting in and out.

One of the settings I can see that is recommended which is currently off is conference mode. Is that likely to assist with this issue? The only problem is, the same call queue has Poly VVX411's tied to them,  and I don't think they are compatible with the conference mode options as they are legacy and not Teams Certified Devices.

Has anyone had anything similar or could offer some advise? I have logged with Microsoft previously, but they didn't get very far with resolving it, I have logged it again today with further information.

If one person is absent, the others can ""remove"" individual tasks from a task pool and place and process them in their own task pool. Tasks that are still left and need to be done are immediately visible and can be taken by everyone. It's important that the tasks get half or completely done in a set  7 of time.
It's about 4-6 tasks a day, 5 a week and 5 tasks a month. Special tasks or meetings are communicates differently.

Several of my rooms and users are working, but more recently, it appears a change was made with Call2Teams/MS in how the API behaves... The issue I'm seeing when trying to Sync call2teams with MS Teams states that the API doesn't allow assigning numbers in the cloud and to reach out to MS Support.

In so doing, MS Support is asking me to run the command to manually assign the phone # to the user, however we keep getting an error stating that The user is not licensed for PSTN calling... even though the user clearly has PSTN calling enabled.

Any ideas/thoughts/suggestions?",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/pjt5nb/ms_teams_direct_routing_issue_vonage_business/,RexfordITMGR

Recently, a few members of my organization have been receiving absolutely no Teams notifications on iOS.

We use 3CX as our phone system and just enabled the Direct Routing option with MS Teams which adds it as a SBC to Teams.  3CX provides the custom PowerShell script to run to configure and set up the SBC.  Everything is working great except V\\voicemail.  I want to use Teams voicemail, not 3CX, so I disabled voicemail for all users on 3CX, but no one has voicemail as an option in the Teams client anymore.

When I go to settings in Teams on my Mac and then to Calls, it has ""If unanswered"" which is empty and only has ""New number or contact"", Group, or Do Nothing, when it used to have Voicemail.  There's also no mention of voicemail anywhere in the settings.  On my Android and iPhone it does show If unanswered send to voicemail, and has an option to change voicemail greeting, but if you press change greeting, it tries to dial out to ""Voicemail"" but says call failed.

If we call any users externally it just rings forever, no Teams voicemail ever picks up.  Is it possible it is disabled for users somehow?",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/pjxfc4/using_direct_routing_with_3cx_as_our_sbcphone/,psykobunnyto

I have a decade of experience with Microsoft stuff, although the last 5 years I've been running my computer repair shop and rarely to touch any server stuff. I do some work with Microsoft 365 (mostly migrations) and Teams. To brush up on concepts, I studied for MS-900 for about two weeks and passed it today.

About a year ago, I also read an MD-100 book and thought I could pass it easily but didn't pull the plug on the exam when I realized I would also need MD-101 to get the Associate badge, and I don't have any experience with Configuration Manager, Intune, and Defender.

MS-700 looks like the next logical step (especially in the last 18 months!) but I read there is a lot of overlap from MS-100, which is an expert certification. However, I'm familiar with most of the concepts in it.

So, what would you do next?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/pk5tns/passed_ms900_today_should_i_do_ms100_or_ms700_next/,FruitSuch7627

My uni is still doing lectures over teams this semester, and all of my subjects currently have the recordings of their lectures set to ""view only"", which as far as I can tell means that it blocks the ability to download the lectures. I can understand why the lecturers would want to make sure their lectures don't get downloaded and shared, but I'm in a situation in which downloading lectures would be really useful to me. Is there a way to work around the download block? Some kind of chrome extension or a way to access the raw file with inspect element?

I just think it's a unique perspective and there are some interesting things to talk about, like running a software business.

Would love to start some of monthly chat, but happy to just have a pen-pal :)

So if you've built an app that's in the Teams store, SharePoint store, AppSource, or even if you are planning to and haven't yet, let me know.

Thanks

They have a ThinkPad laptop with an internal camera/mic/speakers, and a Logitech webcam/mic and external speakers.

The issue is that Teams does not ""see"" any of the audio/video devices and shows ""none"" when I go to Settings/Devices.

Other applications (Zoom, etc) see the devices with no issues.

I have confirmed that all other applications are shut down and are not running.  Multiple reboots, etc.
I have updated the Logitech webcam firmware - and the utility to do so found the webcam with no issues.

I  have confirmed that there are no a/v utilites (such as zoom) running in the system tray next to the clock.

I have uninstalled and reinstalled Teams (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app)

I have performed a hard-reset on the ThinkPad (they have a reset button that disconnects laptop from battery...)

I cannot figure out why I'm suddenly having this issue - it was working previously, and just stopped working in the past few days.

2021-09-10 02:07:54,Non persistent VDI,"Hey,
we are using a non persistent VDI solution with FSLOGIX and are facing some troubles with teams. I thought I will ask you guys because I'm out of ideas. 

Current setup:
Windows 10 20h2
No teams activated in our tenant
Non persistent vdi with fslogix office containers for all office/teams settings
Azure PTA activated
Seamless SSO activated

Question 1
Is it possible to disable seamless single sign on only for teams? 
We are working for other companies and need to login in teams with their email instead of ours (e.g. I'm logged in with domain1.com to my vdi session and I'm activating office with sso in my session. But in teams I'll have to use domain2.com to login)

Currently teams always tries to login with our domain (I think seamless sso) and then after a long timeout we get an error (teams is not active in our tenant) and we are able to click a logoff button and login with the domain of the other company.

Question 2
Is fslogix able to persist teams credentials from session to session? Where does teams store the credentials?

When we are finally logged in to teams with the mail from the other company everything is working fine until we logoff from the vdi session and login again. At the new vdi machine ( non persistent VDI - we always get a new machine at each login) teams tries to login with our domain again and everything starts from scratch.

I hope my explanation is not too bad and anyone of you guys has an idea how to fix this behavior.

2021-09-10 14:45:05,"""Some"" external users (b2b) cannot join our scheduled meetings","Hi there,

We've started using Teams in a heavily regulated industry and are slowly rolling out (island mode) with a first set of pilot users. We are heavily in the B2B space, so all of our customers and partners are using Teams already (hence our move).

We're running into issues now where ""some"" clients are unable to join our meetings, and they are getting the dreaded: ""Only people with access to this org can join its meetings"" when they sign in.

This seems to be only for some customers (we're still investigating) who are also highly regulated.

Our settings:  
\- Guest access / join : disabled (policy set by risk / security)  
\- External domains: Allow all 

Findings:  
\- Most of the meetings hosted by us that have external users work fine and most of them can join  
\- Only in some cases they get the error message when logging into the meeting with their teams account  
\- I have my own O365/teams account and cannot reproduce this ( as I can just join the meeting).

Since this only happens with a subset of customers (it seems) and it's not an issue 90% of the time, what direction can you point me in to fix this issue? Is this possibly a policy setting at the side of our invitees that blocks THEM from joining OUR meeting?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/plfru6/some_external_users_b2b_cannot_join_our_scheduled/,las3rr

We have a logitech tap teams room system in our main boardroom and for the most part it works well.  Forwarding Zoom meetings to the room though were hit and miss.  I had checked the calendarprocessing powershell settings and a bunch of other stuff until I figured out what I think is the issue; URL defense rewriting.

We use Proofpoint and it rewrites URLs as [urldefense.com](https://urldefense.com) to protect from future weaponization of the links.  I explicitly added exclusions though for Teams, Zoom, and WebEx links.  It would be nice if these products would have this as a default.

Our partner who sent us a zoom meeting is using a URL rewriter [edgepilot.com](https://edgepilot.com) so the Zoom URL looks like this:

Our Teams room obviously doesn't know what to do with that; it is looking for just the sub URL that [edgepilot.com](https://edgepilot.com) is protecting.

2021-09-11 19:43:46,Microsoft Office fixes four security vulnerabilities | Digital Software Market,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5yyzwct43vm71.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41a8d9acedcf980ab3a30c49a78de2da6d24dcbc

 Cyber Security firms pointed **Microsoft Office** vulnerabilities to checkpoint research in a tool called MSGraph, which was in use by the office suite since 1995.

According to cybersecurity firms, Microsoft needs to update Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Office as the office suite has just received important critical security patches to fix four security flaws. 

Previously the security flaws in Microsoft office were identified which showed that an attacker can take control of a computer, read and access files — and even install ransomware on it, locking its files behind a password until a specified sum of money is paid, mostly in cryptocurrency. 

The flaws were identified in a tool found in the [Microsoft Office](https://www.digitalsoftwaremarket.com/product-category/microsoft-office/) software called MSGraph. They are using the office suite since 1995 and it is extremely old. The vulnerabilities are the result of mistakes made in legacy code found in Excel95 File Formats, giving researchers reason to believe that the security flaws have existed for several years. 

**Microsoft Office** vulnerabilities are very common, the large codebase has expanded to add new features and functions over the years. The company regularly updates its software for performance improvement and security fixes like the recently issued update to fix the security flaws detected by the security firm. Several flaws have been discovered by “fuzzing” MSGraph which is used to display charts and graphs inside the [Microsoft Office suite](https://www.digitalsoftwaremarket.com/product-category/microsoft-office/). Fuzzing is a technique to automatically find coding errors and security loopholes in software by randomly feeding invalid and unexpected data inputs into a program, to discover software bugs that can be exploited.

For the reinforcement of the security flaws, users will have to visit window updates. In order to stay protected from the new security flaws follow the following steps: 

Click on the start button and then go to the settings, click on updates and security, and then click on windows updates.

Check for updates manually on the main screen, then go to Advanced options and select the Automatic option under Choose how updates are installed.

Restart your system after the updates have been installed. 

Although only four vulnerabilities have been spotted till now, there can be zillion others that are yet to be identified.

Windows users are highly recommended to update their software immediately as there are numerous attack vectors possible by an attacker who triggers the vulnerabilities that are being found.

2021-09-13 07:11:42,Is this could be a good idea ?,"Recently i joined a new team working on an e-commerce website for a big company, we use Bitbucket Cloud for version control and Microsoft Teams for communication.

First thing i had to do is to fix some minor bugs so i fixed them after that i opened a pull request, what was surprising for me is the time it takes (2 days) to have my pull request validated and merged, so by curiosity i asked my tech lead about that he said sometimes when he receives email from Bitbucket to review some PRs he simply ignores it because maybe he didn’t have space at that time. And i was like it’s easy it should be some bitbucket and Microsoft Teams integration app that can helps us to solve this issue, indeed we found it and we gave it a try it was working fine every time someone open a PR we get notified to do the review but it didn’t solve the problem, why ? Because we receive the notifications and if we ignore it because of bad timing we don’t have any kind of reminders to do so. And really this was the real issue for us and we didn’t find a way to solve it til now.

This weekend i was thinking why not building it my self and maybe share it with other developers having same issue what do you think is it a great idea ? I need your feedbacks, And I built a simple landing page to collect some developers emails for the beta version if you think that it could solve your issue you could leave your email to get notified when the beta is released.

The county officials post a link to scheduled Team meeting(s) on the county’s calendar on their website.

My question is, what are they seeing on their end? When I first attempt to join the meeting, do they get some sort of notification? Is it automatic that attendees get placed into the waiting room? Or are they going out of their way, not allowing me to attend these meetings?

2021-09-14 21:10:42,Direct Routing config: Resource account &amp; auto attendant do not work with external numbers,"Hi,

I have a strange problem.

Our environment is setup with direct routing with a hosted SBC from a local provider. When I link the numbers to users there are no problems and the connection works smooth.

The problem is when I assign the phone number to a resource account and assign that resource account to an autoattendant.  
(I added the virtual user license, I assigned the voicepolicy to the resource account)

When I call the number (assigned to the resource account) from an internal number, it works perfect.

When I call the number from an external number the call connects, but it's like the auto attendant is not working. The call is picked up, I see the time counting, but after a few seconds the call disconnects.

Anyone knows what could be wrong with my resource account?

The organizer can still see the meeting notes from the rooms but it's somewhat inefficient as someone who was in a room may want to go back to the notes to provide feedback on what they discussed but cannot.

2) Is there a way to share a document to only one room or a different document to Room 1 and 2?  I can't seem to see a way to share a document to each room separately.

Having an issue currently, and I will do my best to explain it. 

I was looking at our Direct Routing set up and noted that both SBCs we have in TAC were showing with warnings, or the Network Effectiveness was poor. 

Digging in I found our SBCs had some errors per TAC. 
408 SBC failover timer expired - 5 calls affected
503 Service unavailable. SBC undergoing maint or temp overloaded.- 10 calls affected.

Now, I cannot find out so far which calls were affected. No user information, no time stamps, nothing. 

I reach out to our provider as they monitor and run the SBCs. They need specifics. Date, time, UPN, etc. TAC offers none of that. They also show no issues reported on the SBCs. 
They then also ask how MS is obtaining these errors. 

I also have a ticket open with MS, but they too need specifics on these calls affected. Again, looking around the TAC, I simply cannot identify any dropped calls.

I was lucky enough to be on a call with a user and they were ""dropped"" several times early in the call. When he switched from headset to computer audio, no more drops. 
Once the TAC had call data, we looked, and it shows nothing. No drops, as it was likely his headset in this case causing the issue. Simply appeared to be several short calls. Audio quality good, nothing.

I say all of this to ask you all, when you hear of dropped calls, or see errors where 15 of 150 calls are affected, where do you begin with information gathering? 
I'll admit, I am a little new to Teams as a phone system, but was told it holds a ton of data and great troubleshooting tools. So far, I am finding that to be false.

2021-09-16 21:35:09,Teams Rooms universal compatibility,"I'm seeking an improvement to our meeting experience and am researching Teams Rooms. Our org is a multi-service law firm in the US.  We use an integrated Windows PC in all of our conference rooms so users can launch a meeting however the **host** requires. We often can't dictate what platform will be used (like proxy services for depositions, event platforms for speaking, etc) and the room PC setup, with all it's pitfalls, has been the most flexible solution thus far.

I've read countless articles highlighting native scheduling compatibility with Zoom and WebEx meetings and that's nice. But what would you do if one of your users came to you with a meeting hosted by a proxy on an unsupported platform (like LoopUp or something) and they have to install a Windows desktop application to run the meeting?

Use a room PC and a Teams Room system and switch between the two, right? But the camera, speakers, and mic have to be tied to both. And it's a stretch to assume that an attorney, with all their legal wisdom, has the patience to deal with figuring out technology before appearing in front of a district court judge.

Leads me to believe I'm missing part of the puzzle. **Current Teams Room admins: How do you handle this?**",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/ppdf77/teams_rooms_universal_compatibility/,NorwayPines

The numbers are numbers I requested trough the admin portal, and are thus Microsoft numbers. I've read on a forum that it is impossible to port away Microsoft requested numbers? Do I not own these numbers myself? Are they still in posession of Microsoft?

Does anyone here have experiences with porting out numbers from Teams to an other provider?

2021-09-20 22:13:09,URGENT! How to change or remove my own username as the last modifier of an excel file that was originally uploaded by my teammates in MS Teams?,"Hello!

I have an urgent enquiry that I hope someone can answer.

So we use this MS teams for our online class. We were tasked to upload an excel file (which contains the answers for our exam) to upload in an openly accessible folder created by our professor.

As I was uploading my own excel file, I accidentally clicked/opened the excel file of my classmate and I didn't notice that it didn't immediately close successfully upon clicking and opening the file. After closing the file, I noticed that my name already displays as the last modifier of my classmate's excel file. And now I'm afraid, my professor would think that I changed/copied my classmate's answers.

I messaged my classmate immediately and even called him to delete the old file and reupload again but he's not responding my chats nor answering my calls. 

So, I looked for ways how I can edit the version history. I tried to restore the version history through MS Sharepoint from the oldest version (modified by my classmate), but despite this, the last modifier being shown is still me and it just added another version history under my name. I cannot delete the current version under my name even after the restoration to the original version. I can delete the original version under my classmate's name though.

Please help me, what can I do? Is it possible to delete the current version I accidentally created under my name and just keep the initial version the time my classmate uploaded it?

3. Other users can reply to this thread. It is usually a higher up issuing an approval or requesting some change to the way the task is supposed to be completed. 
4. Once approved, a process of completing the task is kicked off (this is not an online process as it involves picking items/ billing. )
5. Once task is complete, the initial user who created the task will tick it off. This will mark the task as completed, and the thread will be updated saying xx user marked as completed.

I purchased a new Asus ROG Strix G15 (G513QM) and I've been experiencing some strange issues with using Microsoft Teams.

It seems whenever I'm in a call (even with video off or camera disconnected) it freezes my computer entirely, I get a flickering black screen and then if I try to do anything it gets completely frozen. I need to force close Teams in order to get back in the call.

It's very frustrating since I'm using it daily for remote work.

Has anyone experienced this and found a solution? I would appreciate it very much.

We have numerous users in my company that are guest in other tenants, and as such have access to Teams teams in those tenants like [this](https://i0.wp.com/samuelmcneill.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Teams-Switch.png?w=350&amp;ssl=1). I don't know how widespread this issue is, but it has happened to at least two of my users. When a user at my company accesses the Teams Tenant, of let's call them Company B and then returns to our tenant, they see a mixture of the ""we're sorry--we've run into an issue"" or ""Oh no, we can't connect to the internet"" messages in Teams, or they'll be presented with the loading wheel forever. In some cases they've even seen delays in receiving messages for up to several hours. There doesn't even seem to be consistency in the symptoms. I should also add that when the users see the connection issue, other internet applications on their PC continue to function, and Teams still behaves normally on their mobile.

I've purged the cached files from %appdata% and reinstalled Teams to no avail. The only work around I've managed to come up with is to have the user sign out and sign back into Teams, but this only lasts until they switch back to the tenant they're a guest in, but I'm not really happy with presenting this to a user as a ""fix""

Has anyone seen anything similar or know of a fix better than my workaround? Any help would be truly appreciated.",1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/psooht/strange_issue_for_users_that_are_guest_in_another/,tehdangerzone

All members were added to the newly created Team manually via email address.  A meeting was scheduled and shared with all members (internal and external). 

When the meeting began we learned that all community members were designated as guests.  ***The problem was that no guests had access to the Chat feature*** where all of our important links and discussions were taking place. 

I couldn't find any permissions under Settings &gt; Guest Permissions that seemed relevant (Allow guest to update and create channels and Allow guest to delete channel were the only options). 

The only area I'm seeing here - where things could go wrong - is the creation of the invitation? (I didn't make the invite so I'm not sure how it was done).  It appears on my calendar as having come from ""Team Name"" not the individual who made it. If I am in Teams, looking at my calendar - how would I make an invite that is from a Team and not from Me?  By designating a channel?   Is there a setting here somewhere that allows me to give guests more permissions?  How do we send an invite to all team members (I'm sure the person who did the invite didn't enter emails one by one but somehow sent it out to all members).

2021-09-24 12:10:09,Teams Personal Vs Teams Work,"In a month, we will start having externals with Win11 and they will all have Teams for Personal Use, pre-installed and signed in with the account they activated windows. No more straight to browser to join meetings. So how the personal app works will have to enter our guides

On mobile: You can sign in to both personal and work account. You get notifications regardless which account is currently in use = nice

On Windows personal app (Win11) you get pre-installed the personal use app. Getting an invite from Work will bring up teams personal and clicking Join will not work. Hopefully it will be fixed. Joining with browser is always an option

Meetings in personal are not the same as meetings in work. Personal is just a 24h link to share. No email invites, no presenters and attendees. Just a link where everyone is a guest. Opening that in Work will work and you will join with the guest screen (enter your name)

On Windows work app, you can sign in to both work and personal. When you switch to personal, a second window appears (consider that as a Windows tab). That is because Personal is a lighter app, with no Channels and Tabs. However notifications will not cross over accounts. If you are in work, you won't get notified for personal (yet). Current work-around: enable windows notifications, as even if they don't come in the app, they do exist and windows gets them.

Win11 will give an extra boost in Teams use. It is already bigger than Zoom in meetings, but with Win11 it will compete with the chat apps too. Meaning more external connections to our internal systems. And this will become even more intense when we will be able to have Private group chats from Work with external emails (like we do today with meetings) and when we get the Teams Shared Channels where we can add guests that are not part of that Team at all.

I hope all these will make our lives easier and not give us another MS headache",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/puc2eq/teams_personal_vs_teams_work/,zaqwsx1

Normally

I hit the Computer button and it turns green and directs the computer's audio into my headset.  I am able to listen to music and use the multitude of other teleconferencing apps.  This used to work fine on Teams with my old computer.

Now on new computer

Everything works fine, until Teams is launched.  Once Teams is launched the Computer button only brings the Teams window into focus, never turns green, and does not direct audio (mix/speaker) to my headset.  The only way to get audio to the headset is to initiate a meeting in Teams.  This breaks everything.  No other app is able to use the headset. The only way to restore proper functionality is to quit teams, unplug and replug the USB on my headset base.

What should I focus on, my thoughts are:
Now
- Creating one document library and having a comprehensive mapping doc showing where the put things
- Training how to use synced files and avoid sync issues

In a few weeks
- move to teams for chat and online document library access
- moving all notes to personal or teams One Notes

In a month
- Setting up an intranet page, accessible through SharePoint with key links and guidance docs, to give new starters a place to start
- somewhere to store PDf official policy docs, ideally so they're searchable
- OneNote Wiki ( as Teams wiki sucks)
- SharePoint lists for contract tracker, start/end dates etc

I added this dial plan, as I want users to be able to dial \*8 before a number and have it get sent to the SBC exactly like that.  i.e. if dialing 416-200-3000 they dial \*84162003000 and it sends it exactly like that.

I created this dial plan which works when I enter the number in that format as a test:

However all calls still fail.  I was told by support that I need to modify the voice route here under dialed number plan:

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, do I need to change anything on there to make this work?  Right now I cannot make anything work.  When doing the dial plan test above with \*84162003000 it says valid E.164, but the SBC never even reflects this coming into it which is why I think it's this dialed number pattern thing blocking it.

I’m looking to make a teams bot, with the use case that you’d be able to send it some text, and receive some text; it would work in a one to one chat, but I’m also hoping for it to work in a group chat such that you invoke the bot with an @ mention, it presents a model in which you can do the text input, but importantly I *don’t* want the other chat members to see what is sent to the bot as it could be sensitive data

I'm an indie-dev currently working on an app for Microsoft Teams ([https://mycheckins.io](https://mycheckins.io)).

I just wrapped up all development work and QA. The beta is ready and I'm in the process of rolling it out. The app is supposed to be listed on the app store post a few weeks of beta usage.

I went through all Microsoft Documentation for launch and listing but I'm curious to hear about experiences from others who have built and launched apps for Microsoft Teams.

\- What was your experience like? If you could do it again, what would you do differently?

\- How did you manage the beta? How did you find users? 

\- What was your onboarding process like when you weren't listed on the app store?

\- What was your launch plan like? What worked and what didn't?

Any advice or tips would be super helpful. I'd be happy to hear your stories.

&gt;Open UDP ports 3478 through 3481 outgoing from clients that will use Teams. 

They also recommend to turn off any packet inspection, anti-virus, certificate inspection, etc...

I guess beside that, is there anything else I should consider? Like right now, I have configured a rule to allow traffic on port 3478 to 3481 and 80/443 to the range of IPs given my MS in their doc.

2021-09-30 00:59:54,Teams cloud voicemails being sent to Dist Lists,"We use Direct routing and cloud voicemail, we also have auto attendants in place with dial by name. Every so often we get a voicemail to one of our IT dist lists thats obviously spam. The call details show the call coming into our main number, going to our auto attendant and then the voicemail gets delivered to the dist list. We have excluded groups and dist lists from lookup, and have tried dozens of times to call in and reproduce the ability to get to voicemail / this dist list. This is a true dist list, not even a 365 group so its not attached to a call queue as a destination. We also cant even transfer to this dist list from within teams. At a loss of how a voicemail is getting to this dist list. I ran message traces and its not showing as being forwarded by another sender or anything of that sort.

\- We both aren't the Meeting owner.

\- We both have same policy assigned (Checked in Teams Admin). 

\- **Chat in meeting** is enabled (people can chat... but that user just cannot delete/edit). 

\- **'Owners can delete sent messages'** and **'Delete sent messages'** are enabled in the policy

this one is driving us crazy and i hope that maybe someone of you may have anymore suggestion on what we may try.  


We have a 100% Lenovo Thinkpad Based Environment with various Generations of Devices (Mostly T570, T580, T590 and a few older T540p). The Devices run with either 32GB or 40GB  of memory, have i7CPUs and all of the newer models are one with dedicated Nvidia GPUs (MX150 / MX250). The 540p only have Intel GPUs. 

Now the issue: Teams freezes. But not only teams. It freezes the whole PC 70% of the time whenever video calls are done (ingoing as well as outgoing). Not everytime for every one but it is a constant issue that is wandering from person to person. A short time into the call and the PC will just freeze completely so that a shutdown and reboot is the only way. We even have 2 cases where the monitors will just turn black (both T570 with Ultra Dock and 2x27"" Displays attached) and have to be turned off and on again together with a reboot of the system.   


We tried all things and went into all directions we came across on the web like the Realtek Driver Issue, Keeping Drivers up to date as well as the OS (all run Windows 10 Pro) via System Update including Firmware, Re-Installing Teams and some even tried reinstalling their whole PCs.   


This seems to be an issue that is, when faced, heavily related to Lenovo Laptops but i also found one guy who faced the same issue with his company using HP Laptops and the problem went away after switchting to DELL devices. However: I just cant imagine that there isnt a solution for this.   


Has anyone ever encountered this problem and may even have new thoughts or input for me? 

&amp;#x200B;

I will keep this post updated. At the moment im trying to test on Systems were i uninstall our Trend Micro Worry Free Business Standard AV Client for test purposes.

2021-10-01 22:45:24,Outlook calendar visibility for channel meetings,"Here's an interesting one. 

# Context

We have a team working on a large project in our company. The team members are spread around geographically, so Teams is being used heavily. The team consists primarily of internal members, but also includes external consultants, who are guests in the team. 

They want to create a series of virtual meeting rooms that people can bounce in and out of each day, as needed. We did something like this at the beginning of the pandemic with Cisco Meeting Spaces, but Teams is our go-to at this point. 

My suggestion to them was to create a series of channels within the team that would serve as meeting rooms. (Sales, Finance, Production, etc.). A recurring meeting could be set up for each channel and by not inviting individual users in the invitation, people's Outlook calendars would not be clogged up with these meetings. (The only exception is the meeting organizer). 

# The issue

The consults, who are external guests, are receiving email notifications AND the recurring meeting is showing up in their calendars, which is clogging things up for them. 

I've never experienced this before. Frankly, I haven't been asked to set anything like this up before, either, so I'm flying by the seat of my pants here. 

I've checked Teams admin and PowerShell to see if there's something there that would allow me to control this but nothing is standing out to me.

As a workaround, I was going to have my users click the ""Open in app"" button, but ran into another issue - ""Open in app"" opens .ppsx files in the PowerPoint editor mode.

As another workaround, I decided to ditch the embedded form and instead link to the web version.  Upon testing, I've discovered that hyperlinks no longer function if the presentation is accessed from a .ppsx in Teams.

I'm thinking I'll need to either distribute the actual .ppsx file or have my users go into the .pptx and start the slide show manually.  Because of the audio, I'm somewhat limited for things like exporting as pdf.  Is there any other way to make a presentation with audio and embedded forms directly viewable in Teams?",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/q1a8jl/ppsx_compatibility/,Kelsier25

2021-10-05 22:26:27,Revoking access to a group chat history,"Hi guys

Got an interesting one here.

Some executives in my organization have an ongoing group chat. They occasionally discuss sensitive business-related topics.

A couple of days ago one of them temporarily added some other persons to the conversation to get their input on the topic of the day. They've now come to me because they've realized that this person will have access to the entire chat history, even after they've been removed from the chat.

Surely there's GOT to be a way to revoke someone's access to the chat history. In my research, all I'm seeing are people frantically asking ""OMG PLEASE HELP I NEED TO DELETE A CHAT HISTORY"" (I already know that the short answer is: you can't).

Am I missing something? Once you've given someone access to a group chat, is there seriously no way to revoke access to the history?

2021-10-05 23:17:26,Team Auto-Renew Feature,"Hey guys,

I've searched all the googles, and this sub and I found a couple similar posts but no sufficient answers.

We recently implemented teams in sort of a pilot phase at our company and I've been put in charge. I want to minimize unnecessary bloat, while giving users the most freedom by allowing them to create their own teams/channels whenever they want. I thought the Group expiration policy sounded perfect for this. The trouble is I don't think its working (at least not the way it seems like it should). 

For testing purposes I created a few teams and made myself the owner, and added a few members. I applied the expiration policy for 60 days to those groups (teams). From what I've read, around day 35 from expiration it is supposed to check for activity (users visiting a team channel) and auto-renew the group if activity is present.

I have been posting in my teams daily, creating polls, posting gifs, etc... to keep them active.

This morning I just got the emails saying my teams with be deleted if I don't renew them, and the expiration date in the 365 admin console on those groups has not changed. What am I doing wrong?

How much activity does there need to be so that it is ""active"" enough  for auto-renewal? My management does not want me to implement this feature unless I can prove the auto-renewal works.

2021-10-06 19:31:50,Why meetings only appear to me to join some time after they started?,"Hey guys, Idk if this is the best sub to ask questions about online classes, but I think you guys may help me. My college classes are still being online, and they decided to use Microsoft Teams because it was a very complete program, with tasks, lots of tabs, easy to use, but I noticed that like, 40% of the time the classes/meetings never appear on the right time they should start.

I'm not from the US, but here my classes start 8 a.m and ends at 11 a.m, and sometimes it takes almost up to 20 minutes to appear on my screen to join it. Now, here, it's 8:15 a.m, and the class only appeared joinable as it started now, almost 15 minutes after it already begun. The worst part is that this seems only to be happening to me, since when the classes finally appear started to join to me, all the other 40 students are already there and the meeting always being recorded.

This disturbs my study a lot because I end up losing essential content and minutes of the class that I should be taking notes because I don't know if it already started, or either I lose the attendance sheet and I need to keep explaining to teachers that I didn't missed the class and the Teams just didn't warned me that the class started.

And it always appears a message that the teacher had scheduled a meeting to, for example, next friday at 9:40 a.m like usual, but the purple tab to join class only appear for me after lots of minutes, and when it appears it always says like ""Class RADIO TV AND INTERNET TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS"" then the red dot that appears when the class is being recorded, then the minutes (usually 15:00 up to 20:00) and all the students photos with a +32 students mark.

And we **don't want any extra registration or log-in step** for the readers. It's pretty much to act like a de-facto intranet menu, and hyperlink-able via an email. (We don't want to use SharePoint for reasons I won't bore you with.)

2021-10-07 11:17:34,Calling Plan/Direct Routing and Least Cost Routing Question,"Hello.

I have a question regarding Calling Plans, Direct Routing, and LCR.

In one of our regions, we are using an SBC (cloud hosted) which is registered in Teams under Direct Routing.
Another region wants to use Calling Plans, with numbers provided by Microsoft.

If we do this, would it be possible for users with the calling plan numbers to be able to route calls out to the SBC in the other region?

Example: User in USA with calling plan number wants to call client in France, so wants call to be routed via SBC hosted in France.

In that same vein, would it be also possible for users who have numbers assigned via Direct Routing be able to route calls out via  a shared Calling Plan number?

Everything is fine apart from teams. It appears that there is a WVD/AVD optimised version that's deployed by default. The issue is that these optimisations seem to be causing a lot of issues with teams.

Examples of some of the issues include:

* Audio/camera devices not being detected by teams despite the fact that they're working in other apps on the WVD or display in control panel. 
* Screen sharing not working. Blank screens or fuzzy screens with part of it missing. This goes both ways so the user may be unable to share their screen or see the shared screen of a remote device.
* If the camera is detected, it may come up completely black for someone on the other side of the call. The WVD user may be unable to see the camera of someone they are speaking to.

I've tried following the limited Microsoft documentation on the topic and raised a case with Microsoft with no success so far.

The thing that I've found helps is turning off the DWORD ""IsWVDEnviroment"" in the registry key HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Teams. This seems to turn off most of the optimisations and improves the experience for the user considerably and actually makes it useable. However it appears that some ""optimisations"" such as being unable to zoom in remain and there are a few issues that aren't present on normal teams.

I'm starting to believe that turning off all of the optimisations is the way forward so if anyone knows how to do that, I'd appreciate it.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/q3vjdp/has_anyone_successfully_deployed_teams_to_a/,jxd1234

2021-10-09 18:29:25,Issue with multiple USB headsets only in Teams,"I have a user with a very odd behavior.

There were some windows updates installed that broke Teams. The most recent updates I found I uninstalled, but the issue remains

Not only the local Teams, but the web version as well has the same issues.

So basically on one USB headset the mic does not work in calls. On the other USB headset it's the opposite and mic works, but the speakers do not.

It works fine everywhere else on the computer. Teams is the only place that for some reason has issues.

Headsets have no issues on an another computer as well.

I have checked Teams audio settings and the correct headset mic/speakers are selected. 

When testing laptops inbuilt mic/speakers all works in calls. No issues with the 3.5 jack as well. It's only the USB headsets that have this issue.

I'm stumped on this, because the issue occurs on the web version of Teams as well which would rule out a local issue.

Checked for available updates which included a BIOS update.

Tried newer and older audio drivers with no success.


Anyone had anything similar happen? Any suggestions what to try next?

I am very close to just asking user to reinstall the computer, but for Teams to be the only affected application is fascinating to me.

I hope someone has some ideas what could be causing this.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/q4ip0w/issue_with_multiple_usb_headsets_only_in_teams/,eCinS

2021-10-12 01:29:20,Share Parts of a Screen e.g. working with a ultra wide monitor,"cheers,

this is a question to you pro user and maybe someone else has the same problem to solve.  
in case of working with an ultra wide monitor with 21:9 or 32:9 res. and your poor team mate has a 16:9 inch monitor, this is a kind of pain in the ass...   


But. We can't just share the app window because we have to switch the app a lot in each session. So that's not the workflow. Otherwise sometimes we have to show some effects from dnd on our Webplattform that is not visible if we only share the app window.  


So maybe... someone of you guys have an idea how we can solve this problem.   
My first idea was in case that I use an LG and they have a tool called OnScreen control... I could split my screen into two 16:9 inch screens and share one of them in teams.. but it seems that this feature is just split the screen into sections and not into separate displays... Teams only shows the full screen...

If teams sharing would allow you to draw a section of your screen to share would be the best solution in my point of view.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/q60zw1/share_parts_of_a_screen_eg_working_with_a_ultra/,Saintenr

2021-10-12 04:08:19,Microsoft Teams Rooms &amp; Cortana,"I figured out a workaround while typing my original question up before I submitted it, so turning this into a tip.

I noticed a Cortana button has replaced the Present button on my Teams Rooms system touch panels, and Cortana is unnecessary in our environment (not to mention blocked by the firewalls). Therefore I sought out how to remove it.

First attempt was the Settings panel on the device which has a Cortana slider: sliding it to off grays out Cortana, but after a reboot she turns back on.

Second attempt was the Teams Admin Center: turned off Cortana via the room’s settings and received a message that it was set and required the room reboot. After rebooting Cortana stays on.

Third attempt was a manual SkypeSettings.xml file: while doing this one I see that there’s already a SkypeSettings.xml file in place that is trying to disable the Cortana setting, but it has some odd characters at the beginning of the file when I view the file via “more SkypeSettings.xml”, so I delete and recreate the file with the correct XML and reboot. SkypeSettings.xml file disappears as expected, but Cortana is still on.

I think a bug is preventing the first three from working.

The attempt that worked (so far)…

I found the PowerShell commands for it and used those. Here’s the whole thing (if you’re already using Microsoft Teams PowerShell, you can skip the first few).

#Import the module and establish a connection
Import-Module -Name MicrosoftTeams
Connect-MicrosoftTeams

#Create a new Cortana policy
New-CSTeamsCortanaPolicy -Identity DisableConferenceRoomCortana -CortanaVoiceInvocationMode Disabled

Enterprise client, lots of shared mailboxes in exchange 2016 on-prem. In the late stages of a teams migration project. Until now they've been using skype for business 2019 (on-prem also).

The client had been sending mass meeting invites from one of their shared mailboxes which we configured with a skype for business account, this all worked fine.

Now we're testing this with teams, the shared mailbox account has an E3 license with teams, and also 365 audio conferencing, and 365 phone system license (not sure that last one is actually necessary but whatever - its there).

The delegate users cannot create teams meetings on this shared mailbox - they *can* do the same thing for other normal user mailboxes where they have the same delegate access. Are we missing something here? Or is this config even supported, does anyone know?

2021-10-12 23:14:01,Question about form/polls created in a new conversation,"So there are at least two ways to create a form in an MS Team channel: You can add Forms as a an app by clicking the + icon near the top of the channel and adding the Forms add. Or you can add a form when you start a new conversation within a channel. I really like the latter option for my use case because it's not cumbersome and doesn't require anyone on my team to click through to another section of the channel or the MS Teams application. But every time I search for help on MS Teams Forms, the help is always about the Forms application added to the channel rather than the one you can just add to a new conversation on the fly.

I basically have two poll questions I'm asking in the channel:

\- Preferred date out of A, B, C, and D, which is single-response

\- Which dates, if selected, can you not attend: A, B, C, D, and this is a multi-response allowed question

The problem is, I cannot figure out if you can view responses this way (i.e. who responded to each question which which answers. I know you can if you add the Forms app and create the form that way, but it seems like you should be able to view responses in the new conversation-type poll too since you can create the poll as anonymous or not. I'm not sure what anonymity matters if I can't view the responses anyway. I'm hoping I'm just missing something but I can't seem to google the issue effective and I can't figure it out.

If you're a System Administrator or something similar there may be a time where you need to upload a ton of users a Team. You don't want to do it 1 by 1, so use a CSV file and Powershell.  


**Download the Teams Module for Powershell**

    Install-module -Name MicrosoftTeams

**Connect to Microsoft Teams** 

    Connect-MicrosoftTeams

**Create a CSV file with a single column names ""*****email*****"", Add user's email's directly underneath the ""*****email*****"" heading and name it ""*****Team*****"".**

**Store your CSV in the ROOT of your C:\\ drive**

**Run the following command**

    Import-Csv -Path ""C:\Team.csv"" | foreach{Add-TeamUser -GroupId ""YOUR-TEAM-GROUP-ID"" -user $_.email}

If everything is successful the members will be added accordingly.

2021-10-14 02:58:37,Stream Teams Meeting,"  Greetings

I work for a municipality. Our City Hall council has been using MS Teams to facilitate committee meetings during covid to allow social distancing, allowing some councillors to attend meetings from home and others in our council chambers.

Our IT division has recently been asked to have the Council Teams meeting also stream to a TV that is in our foyer, as we are starting to allow the public to attend the meetings, however due to ongoing social distancing, we cannot accommodate pre-covid seating in the council chamber, so they want some overflow and have the public be able to watch the meeting in the foyer. 

For IT security, we simply don’t want to join the meeting in the TV in the foyer and have it broadcast unattended. It would be great if there was a method where we could also broadcast the Teams meeting. The TV in the foyer is connected to a Windows PC in kiosk mode. Is there an ability in Teams to simultaneously broadcast out a standard Teams meeting to specific URL? It would be ideal to have our council Teams meeting also viewable without any interaction from a web browser. If this is possible, we are also hoping that there would not be a significant delay between the actual Teams meeting and the broadcasted Teams meeting. I am unsure if there is a method to do this using MS Stream. I have read that you can do this using YouTube, however I would assume that there would be a significant delay using YouTube. Our City Hall also has some reservations using YouTube or Facebook to broadcast council meetings. 

Thank you in advanced for any suggestions or insight on if what I am asking is achievable.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/q7i1gx/stream_teams_meeting/,torbuck

We are experiencing a strange issue after an update to 38 of our Teams Rooms. On Tuesday, 38 of our rooms updated to [4.10.10.0](https://4.10.10.0) and now we are unable to access the menu while in a meeting. When we click on the ellipses, no menu comes up and nothing happens. We cannot switch our content/gallery layouts, control the room, or any other features that the menu provides. 

We have attempted to roll back the update, but all of the old application files have been wiped from the interwebs (at least everywhere I have tried searching). I have disabled the cortana crap that was pushed out, but that had no effect. I am at my wits end and not sure what to do from here, we are basically dead in the water on all of our rooms.

2021-10-15 19:18:39,Teams Telephony - preventing users in a group already on a call from receiving incoming call,"Good Afternoon,

We've recently implemented the Teams Telephony for 2 of our administrative teams. The caller is presented with an option to speak with either teams on dialing our advertised number. 

We're finding users in that group chosen are receiving notification of the incoming call - great, but they also get the notification (and ringtone) even if they are in a call at the time, which is incredibly distracting. We are aware they could set their status to 'DND', but we don't wish to advertise this due to users deliberately setting this status to avoid taking calls. 

Looking online, there is a 'Busy on Busy' policy, here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoftteams/teams-calling-policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoftteams/teams-calling-policy)

So in an example scenario, if an incoming caller selects the option to speak to one of the teams (for example a team of 8 people), if one of those team is in a call, they won't see the notification or hear the ringing of the incoming call, correct? I note in the Busy on Busy policy there are options for 'Enable' or 'Unanswered' - answered taking the caller to the users set option, such as voicemail. But will this give the other members of the team the option to answer the incoming call first? And if I choose 'Enabled' rather than 'Unaswered', can I set this policy to only take effect for incoming external calls, rather than any call, such as one of their colleagues calling them?

2021-10-15 22:32:56,Teams for Mac no longer opening links from chat in Desktop App,"I am in a small organization where everyone is using Microsoft Teams via the desktop app on their different Macs. This has worked great for almost two years. However, recently there was a behavior change that is driving us crazy.

We often send file and file folder links to each other using the Teams chat. Before a couple of weeks ago, we'd send a link to a file or file folder saved in a Teams channel's file section, and that link would open in the desktop app, which was **great**. This kept everything tidy and integrated inside the Teams application, and you could direct someone to the exact file or folder relevant to the project you were discussing.

At some point last month, however, this behavior changed. Now, ***all*** links sent in Teams chat in the desktop application -- even links to internal Teams files -- open in the default browser. The new browser tab logs into the Teams web app and opens the relevant link, but this wastes time **and** opens a new tab every time a link is clicked in Teams. We don't want to use the web app, which is why we downloaded and installed the desktop application. 

I've made sure the ""File open preference"" setting is set to Teams, and I've uninstalled and re-installed the app, but the behavior persists.

This happened to several people across different machines all at the same time, which suggests to me that this was part of an update to the client. Is this Microsoft's *intended* behavior, for links clicked inside Teams to open an outside browser? Any help or guidance would be deeply appreciated.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/q8poxb/teams_for_mac_no_longer_opening_links_from_chat/,salvagebar
2021-10-16 00:32:38,Strange audio limitation,"I have a user who has a USB headset (a plantronics one) on his laptop.  Most of the time he prefers not to use it in teams meetings as they drag on a long time (hours usually) and the headset hurts his ears.  So he usually just uses the integrated mic and speakers on the laptop.

He can then switch to the headset if needed for privacy or whatever reasons.

The problem comes when he joins an external teams meeting.  In this case he is joining a meeting created on another companies servers and is a guest in the meeting.

When he joins he is not given an option to use anything other than the headset.  No other options are available.

I dont think this is a driver issue, as the local audio works fine most of the time.  And i dont think its an issue with his teams setup as he has no issues with any of the meetings on our own server.

This says to me it must be a limitation being enforced from the remote server.  But I cant figure out a) how, and b) why.

2021-10-16 06:31:16,Tasks by Planner Question - Can you copy a bucket?,"I'm a newbie on Teams and Tasks, so apologies if this is a basic question, but I can't figure it out. When you're creating a bucket of tasks, is there a way to copy that bucket within the same tab? I know I can copy a tab of tasks, but I want to create multiple buckets of the same set of tasks first, and then create multiple tabs of those sets of buckets. 

In case this is hard to follow, I'm trying to use Tasks to plan a magazine. I want a Tab of Tasks to represent each section of the magazine, and each bucket to represent an article or asset that has multiple action steps that needs to be addressed. So one Tab of Tasks might look like:

|*Article 1*|*Article 2*|*Special Feature 1*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Research|Research|Research|
|Asset Cultivation|Asset Cultivation|Asset Cultivation|
|Assign to Writer|Assign to Writer|Assign to Writer/Artist|
|Writing Draft 1|Writing Draft 1|Draft 1|
|Editing - Editor 1|Editing - Editor 1|Editing - Editor 1|
|Editing - Editor 2 (there might be 5 of these)|Editing - Editor 2 (there might be 5 of these)|Editing - Editor 2 (there might be 5 of these)|
|and so on, with maybe 15-20 tasks on each article/feature|and so on, with maybe 15-20 tasks on each article/feature|and so on, with maybe 15-20 tasks on each article/feature|

2021-10-16 23:04:20,Teams DTMF Touch Tones does NOT work with Live Operator?,"To put it in layman terms, there are two type of operator in any audio conferencing bridge, one is IVR (Interactive Voice Response) and other is Live Operator (Actual Person).

Live Operator is the one who takes decision based on your response (press *1 to ask question) then operator will call you out to proceed with asking the question to presenter/someone else.

Now, suppose we make a PSTN call to that bridge number through Teams Dialpad (under Calls section), you all know we have a little dialpad waiting for us inside that Teams PSTN window. Using that little dialpad, we used to put in our responses like press *1 for Burger, *2 for Sushi.

These responses are known as DTMF Touch tones and it works fine for IVR but not for LIVE operator.

In other words, these responses gets properly captured by IVR but not by LIVE operator.

Ofcourse, all this happens when using Teams dialpad to make that call otherwise it works fine if we make that same call with mobile.

If anyone needs to perhaps add some extra Security to their Microsoft Teams environment. There are obviously many things you can do, add and configure. Some very effective measures you can take is to make use of Conditional Access and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

These measures are not just used for Microsoft teams but today we're focusing on Teams.

If your not concerned about security for your Microsoft teams in your environment due to your unique setup then this is not for you but for the rest of you, this might help you. Who knows, it might prevent some weenie from getting up to no good one day.

Rather safe than sorry as the saying goes.

Anyway the steps I demonstrate here is also exactly what you need to know for the Microsoft MS-700 (Managing Microsoft Teams) exam in case anyone wants to or needs to write that exam. This is obviously not the only thing you need to know for the exam but it's still very important for the exam.

Currently planning out migrating a couple hundred users from one tenant to another tenant. Catch now is that these users are currently using Teams for phones whereas the destination tenant hasn't been configured for that yet. I've found the portal to request all their phone numbers be transferred. What I'm looking for is a way to actually migrate all their call settings and phone number assignments. From what I'm reading, the number port only transfers the numbers into the destination tenant, it doesn't actually assign them to anyone. Really hoping there is a scripted way somewhere so I don't have to manually configure 200+ users and all their call options.

I'm wondering how to play this one, I've got the Global app policy set up for all users which is fine and I control which apps to deploy globally (so far just a couple)

I have had a request for an app to be added to a few in IT and other users around the business and I can't decide which way to go. Would you a)create a policy (copied and pasted from Global) for the app itself so that you know who uses it. b)create a policy group per dept or working group or c) Just add it to global and stop being stingy or d)hopefully the option I've not thought about, which is why I'm here.

I've been asked to provide two pieces of functionality for a client. First is relatively simple, and effectively just an API call to display grid of data in a teams tab app.

The second, I am struggling to get an angle/starting point on. What I want to be able to do is have a teams app pickup the CTI of a call when it arrives (the client uses 8X8 for Teams calls) . Once I get that event/message/something fired, I will then call an API, passing the call identifier and return a bunch of details about the incoming caller (generally insurance information, current policies held et cetera).

Looking at the architecture I can see that there are, tabs, bots, messaging extensions and webhooks as entry points. 

I'm not entirely sure what I require here. Since there is some element of UI involved, will the entry point for something like this be a tab application? If so, can a tab application receive events when a call is arriving? Are events even raised when this happens? 

Or would I have to do something like poll  graph object? Is the graph object even updated?

I guess I'm just struggling to get my feet under the table with were to start the research. I've watched a lot of teams dev videos and been through the github stuff but not getting any traction what a start.

My name is Ryan and I'm an indie (solo) developer and I think working with Contacts in Teams could be improved.

I came across lots of UserVoice posts about contacts and there are several posts here about them.

The speed dial is weird, the contact list is too basic, going through chats to find people is painful, features missing etc etc. 

I think this is a no-brainer as a problem to solve but I'd like to know more.

I'm hoping people can tell me more about their problems and any I might not know about

* Is this just for contacts or with teammates &amp; colleagues as well?
* What things are you missing?
* What do you use at the moment?
* Is it a big deal for your users?
* How would your leadership see this as a problem to solve?

The option to 'share with everyone in organisation' seems to have gone and anyone who didn't attend the training who wants to watch the recording can only do so by being manually added by the person who recorded the training.

I work for two companies that use teams. One is small and is using M365 Business (no Intune), and the other is a larger Corp that is using Enterprise M365 including using a managed profile via inTune for IOS. I am trying to add MS Teams for the larger client to my IpadPro.

I have successfully added both accounts to my Iphone ( this includes the Intune profile as well). However, when I add the second one to my Ipad I go through the enrol procedure, download the profile but when I try to sign in to Teams i get a response saying sign in error.

I have been able to add the Outlook account from both companies to my Ipad without issue, and using Sharepoint and switching between accounts has not been an issue, it is Teams that seems to be a problem.

Is this a known issue with IpadOS Teams? I can't see anything in the Profile restrictions that exclude Teams in fact when I look at the profile it includes Outlook, Teams and Authenticator in the Allowed Apps.

So, what is it , why is it there, how can i remove it and stop it coming back ? I can delete it via my android device - BUT then it will log me out and remove any account personalisation. Why on earth would I want to do that?

We want to do an in person meeting for those in the office, but we want to broadcast the meeting via Teams for our WFH folks.

Below is a simple layout of what our meeting space looks like, and here are a few details:

* At the front of the room, we'll have one person speaking
* In front of them, we'll have an in person audience
* Behind the audience, we'll have a camera connected to a PC that's shooting the speaker and broadcasting their audio/video to Teams
* Behind the camera, at the back of the room, we have a big video wall that we want to use to display a grid view of all the people on the Teams call.  The video wall is connected to a separate PC (not the same one the camera is connected to)

So far this is all pretty simple.  Here's where the curveball comes in... we want all of the people dialed into the Teams call to see a spotlighted image of the speaker, however, for the large display at the back of the room, we want to show everyone dialed into the Teams call EXCEPT the speaker that's physically present in the room.  By default, Teams would show the spotlighted view of the speaker, so in other words the speaker would be looking at their own video on the big display.

We're trying to find a way where we can show spotlighted video of the speaker to everyone on the call, BUT have the big display at the back of the room show a grid view of everyone on the Teams call and NOT display the video of the speaker.

I'm curious if there is a functionality for creating a list (an agenda to be exact) where users are notified when changes are made to that list/agenda. 

Outlook used to work fine but MS changed something where updates to an appointment automatically go do the deleted items. I have found that lots of people miss these updates since they never check their deleted items (I get anxious when I see a blue bold ""1"" and have to go get rid of it immediately!). 

Anyways, if you have some ideas as to how I could potentially exploit Teams, let me know!

Oh, what I started on was creating a group and a channel (if that verbiage is right??) where I have a OneNote page created. An agenda is stored in here but the only way (that I've found) to notify people of changes is to add to the file's conversation (which then pings the associated users).

2021-10-26 03:39:48,Issue with the Files tab in one of my channel.,"Normally I do open a case with MS about things like that, but after done it and being not really happy with the answer, I decided to post here.

The issue is the following:

We have a Teams called Infra with a channel called Infra\_Windows.

When I am in that channel and I click on the Files tab, my document are not displayed at all. Usually the Files tab is pointing at a folder called the same name of the channel. 

In my case, if I take a look at where the tab is pointing to another folder called Windows\_Servers. Maybe a channel that was created at some point back in time.

Anyway, the fact is that for some reason, the Files tab pointing at Infra\_Windows is missing and that a Files tab under the Infra\_Windows channel and pointing at a Windows\_Servers folder.

Anyone can explain this or tell me how to change that. 

Just to be clear, I did opened a call to MS and the response was, it is working like intended because that tab I am clicking in opens the right folder. It is not opening the folder that should normally be opened (Infra\_Windows Files tab opening the Infra\_Windows folder) but the folder that it is opening (Infra\_Windows Files tab opening the Windows\_Server folder) is the right one, got the nuance there ;)

Thanks!

I am trying to be clear about the issue but I can give more precision as requested!",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/qfol2s/issue_with_the_files_tab_in_one_of_my_channel/,matdesj

2021-10-26 05:57:38,"Teams Room setup: large room, several cubes, one big screen","Hello, was wondering if anyone has attempted to setup a ""conference"" room similar to this.

This essentially isn't a conference room, but a large room with six small, low-partition cubes, and one large projector screen that everyone can see. It's where all the developers work and collaborate.

We'd like to be able to have meetings with remote coworkers and everyone in the room sitting in their cubes, utilizing the large screen.

Currently I'm thinking: Teams Room device connected to a speaker and the projector--but with no microphone. Participants in the room have to provide their own microphone. They join the meeting/call, select the Teams room for their playback audio, then use a mic at their desk.

I *think* that will work, right? The audio from the individual mics should not come out of the Team Room device's speakers, causing feedback/delay.

However I'd like to have some nice desk mics at each desk with a mute button, rather than rely on, say,  our headsets sitting on our shoulders with the mic pointing at our mouths. Something that looks like the Logitech Rally Pod Mic. But also, I wouldn't want these mics to be picking up audio from people \~12 feet away. Everyone would have their own mic they can mute/unmute when they want to participate. 

Do these mics usually have noise canceling good enough for that? I have a feeling the typical daisy-chained microphone arrays achieve this by combining all audio into one feed for the room.

Anyhow, thank you for any insight/product recommendations/assistance with this.",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/qfrhpi/teams_room_setup_large_room_several_cubes_one_big/,addMitt

2021-10-26 08:12:15,MS Teams (macOS) crashes when receiving incoming video (1.4.00.22368),"When I use Teams on macOS 12 (Monterey, just released), and I either join a meeting, or receive an incoming video call, Teams crashes and restarts - every single time.

Audio only calls work just fine, and all other functionality seems consistent, but as soon as video starts up from a remote end, boom, the app crashes immediately.

This happened throughout the Monterey Beta in the last 1.5 months (did not start until then; earlier macOS 12 worked fine with Teams), so I can't say if this was something in a Teams update that has an issue, or something in macOS.

Now that macOS 12 is released, I'm hoping to find others who are experiencing this and can suggest options.

I am on a MacPro (2019) with AMD Radeon Pro W5700X 16 GB for graphics.

No other Electron app seems to have issues, and, the Linux version works fine in a Virtual Machine, it's just the macOS version with incoming video.

Tried repeatedly removing all aspects of Teams, rebooting, reinstalling, erasing all preferences, but, nothing seems to help.  Even tried disabling GPU acceleration in the preferences, no difference there either.

2021-10-28 21:05:18,Sound keeps cutting for a few seconds in meetings,"Hi!

On my work laptop, there's a single 3.5mm jack. I have a headset with a microphone included that I plug in that port. 

Now if I used the microphone from that headset, during meetings I stop hearing the others for a few seconds every minute or so. 

The headset works fine on my home computer, I am pretty sure the issue is linked to the noise suppression feature in Teams but I've tried switching to Automatic, Off, Low, it doesn't change a thing. 

My only alternative is using the laptop's mic, but it's not directional and it picks every noise in the house (my kid downstairs, my wife typing right next to me).

Hey All, we have been looking for a partner to help us navigate through the world of SBC’s and direct routing. We haven’t been able to find anyone that has experience with our situation. We are currently based in Iowa and several remote locations. The remote locations have PRI/Analog lines that have DID’s that are locked due to the FCC. We are looking at putting in an SBC to integrate with Teams but have a few questions. We are planning to use the Microsoft Teams PBX as it fits our needs. 

1. Does anyone have any recommendations for an SBC that integrates with PRI/Analog lines?

2. What happens if the SBC goes down? These remote locations regularly lose PRI/Internet throughout the year. We have several users that just hotspot their laptops and continue working. Would they be able to place outbound calls if a user also had a Microsoft Calling plan? What would a possible DR or setup look like for this setup?

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst this is likely a macOS issue I thought I'd post here in case there are any updates needed to Teams to get it working. Perhaps there's a new API or something?

I am running Teams Version 1.4.00.22368. It was last updated on 22/09/2021.

I have an M1 Mac Mini with 16gb RAM.

I was running macOS Big Sur last week, and everything was fine.

After upgrading to macOS Monterey the light comes on the camera (and the microphone works fine in everything) but I get no video. Just black.

I also get no video in FaceTime (which is obviously Apple's) and Skype, but I do, strangely, in Zoom.  
I notice Zoom is a universal binary so perhaps that's a factor? FaceTime obviously is too though, so perhaps not.

Does anyone know if we're ever getting an Apple Silicon build of Teams btw?

2021-10-31 07:26:43,How Does Microsoft Teams Update Shared Documents in Real Time?,"Hi, I'm a millenial that is not very tech savvy, apologies in advance if this is a dumb question but wasn't able to find a general answer in this forum.  I work for a large multinational company and we have Microsoft 365, however my individual department didn't use any of the ""cloud"" features that enable collaboration until recently (we spent most of the pandemic saving documents/files to a network share drive which took forever to save and didn't really allow for efficient collaboration).  Needless to say, we started using Teams last month, and really enjoy the functionality, and also the integration with other Microsoft services.

I was curious HOW documents can be edited/shared in real time, and also how often is work ""backed up"" in the cloud.  For example, I am on the East Coast of the US, and a colleague in London can see me editng a work document or spreadsheet keystroke-by-keystroke in near real-time.  Does data go through one's organization (other than using a corporate VPN for internet of course), and then sent internally to my colleague, or are all Teams accounts (regardless of company/organization) connected directly to ""the Microsoft Cloud"" and handled end-to-end by Microsoft.  If this is the case, does this mean that your outlook email with 365 is sent via a ""cloud"" exchange server somewhere in the country  rather than a locally hosted one?

I'm also curious to know how often data is saved/backed up to ""the cloud?""  I know that there is redundancy in where data is physically saved and with the SLAs provided there isn't really a need to download and save documents, however does this data backup happen only a set amount of times per day (like hourly), or is data backed up in real time?  If I'm working on an important document/file on ""the cloud"" (Teams or SharePoint), I often will download a copy hourly and save to my desktop in the event my work isn't saved.  Is this necessary?

The sound on the laptop itself is great - I can play music at 100% with no problem. However, once I am in a Teams call and leave, playing music takes a few seconds to correct itself to the correct levels. So it appears something that Teams is doing to the audio does affect the whole system. 

For comparison, the same calls sound fine in headphones direct to my laptop, Bluetooth and connected headphones on my cell phone, and my cellphone in regular or speaker mode. I also connected external speakers and they sound poor as well in Teams calls.

2021-11-02 06:01:16,'Team' Discoverability Issues,"I work in IT for a large 'ish' enterprise and we have lots of IT applications that different teams provide support for within the business. Often, engagement initially comes through these teams channels for XYZ application, and we as application support engineers monitor these channels.

At the moment there's no guidance from the enterprise around how these should be structured.

Our main goals are to improve discoverability, and provide some consistent framework for Technology. E.G, if I need support for XYZ application, I want to be able to search for the application in teams, and find the relevant team, join it and ask for assistance/questions.

Right now, our discoverability of these channels suck. These are often linked from confluence support documentation, or provided by someone 'in the know' who can provide the teams channel/team link. You search in the 'join a team' menu and nothing shows up.

Moving forward, we want to improve this. But before we can, we need to know how discoverability works for these teams/channels.

**The question:** does anyone know how the 'join a team' function works? What does it search to find teams? Can it be configured to search descriptions? Metadata?

Anyone else been through this issue? Any advice?

And you can have the current UI as the active mode by default.

The passive mode would be welcomed by people who are not active in chats, and afraid of mistakenly tapping on a button.

2021-11-03 15:52:41,Training Tracking - Microsoft Lists? Dataverse for Teams? Design advice?,"Hey everyone,

I've been having a hard time wrapping my head around this.

We have a list of team members in a List called People. 

We want to track training topics for each team member, example:

* Topic 1
* Topic 2
* Topic 3

The list needs to be easily accessible on mobile devices. Ideally with grouping by team member and showing what areas they've done/not done (with the ability to filter out those who have or haven't been trained on certain topics). And be able to easily update the record to show we've gone over whichever topic with them. 

Lists seems like the ideal choice. It's easiest to use and I can easily get a List up and working across phones leaders use. My original thinking was a new list with a layout of:



Team member name (Lookup)| Topic 1 (Yes/No)| Topic 2 (Yes/No)| Topic 3 (Yes/No)
---|---|----|----
John Doe (from People list)| No| No| No


Making it in my test Team, this works sort of. I would rather have a new List that automatically pulls over all of the *Team member names* from the People list that match a certain criteria (only those from Department A, not Department B), because as it stands they'd have to be added manually. 

Any advice on how I can better accomplish this? It seems like long-term, my above table isn't ideal. It seems like three lists: People, Training Topics, and a combination of the two would be more modular and adaptive to additional training topics would be more future-proof. 

I've been looking at some relational database diagrams to get some ideas, but database design isn't something I've done a lot of. It doesn't seem overly complicated to build this, but something like this should ultimately be doable in Lists, no? 

Dataverse for Teams seems to give some more capabilities in terms of table relationships, but building Power Apps seems to go from 0 to 100 really quickly once you step outside of basic functionality.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/qlpld1/training_tracking_microsoft_lists_dataverse_for/,Danorexic

I've got a Team that has both employees as owners/ members and clients as guests. It's important to note that this Team was created for me and that current policy does not allow me to create my own Teams.

I created a private channel in the Team that has only the employees in it, and important none of the client guests. I attempted to add the Planner app (its full and cumbersome name is ""Task by Planner and To Do""); however, Teams would not let me add it to a private channel. I was able to add it to a public channel no problem. I contacted IT and they confirmed that private channels do not support the Planner app.

I'm a big fan of the Planner app and had hoped to use it to manage this engagement; however, I do *not* want the clients having visibility for all of our tasks. Is there either:

1. A workaround to get Planner working in a private channel, or;
2. An app--preferably a native Microsoft app--that would substantially recreate the functionality of Planner?

2021-11-04 23:28:42,Channel Meeting Invites to specific Members Only?,"Currently trying to move my team away from using chat rooms in Teams to using Channels, especially for meetings

Reason is so that we have ongoing Meeting Notes in a Channel tab, and also so it's easier to navigate to previous meetings to access the chat and any files/links shared. Since our chat rooms have a 2 week retention rule, any events we schedule manually in Outlook create a discrete chat room and its impossible to find it in the sea of chats.

We use each channel for a specific project, and each project has 5-10 people working on it.. We don't need everyone to be in each meeting on the project, but we wat to keep them organized under that Channel, however, it seems that even when only one person is invited to a scheduled channel meeting, everyone is getting invited or notified in some way and its being added to their calendar automatically.

Is there a way to avoid this? Perhaps if there's a way so that not all Channel meetings are automatically added to everyone's calendars and to not notify people of events in channels they're a member of but not planned attendees?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/qmn3hl/channel_meeting_invites_to_specific_members_only/,theassetdotca

If I change the audio device to the pc speakers and mic, and then change it back right away, the audio clears up. I never have issues with regular audio. Or if I turn the headset off and on real quick it fixes. Or unplug the Surface dongle it fixes it.

Sometimes it does the same with my voice to the people on the other end. They say I sound like a robot. Change the settings, change them back and it is fine. Maybe happens once a day or more. The headset switches between audio and voice fine when a call comes in.

1) Since this is a Project tab offered within Teams, team members having access to the channel do not need a MSP license, correct?  I'm adding tasks to the Project tab rather than rely on an actual .mpp from MSP.

2) How do you handle non-working days in the Project app within Teams?  I don't see the ability to add non-working days similar to Change Working Time within the full-blown MSP software.  The Project app doesn't seem to integrate with the Calendar app within Teams.  I also tried adding non-working days (e.g., Thanksgiving) as tasks within my Project app &amp; adding a dependency on that ""non-working day task"" but this just pushes my real actionable task out further.

3) Are there schedule reporting features in this Project app within Teams or maybe just utilize the Filter and views features?

4) Will using the Project app in Teams be sufficient to notify the project team members that they have tasks/action items or is ""Tasks by Planner and To Do"" a better app to use for task/action item notification &amp; reminders?",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/qnfeku/ms_teams_questions_in_relation_to_the_project_app/,sashafurry

If I share my display, does Teams capture all 2560x1600 pixels, so that the pixel doubling is maintained for participants who are using similar displays? i.e. Is what participants see just as crisp and detailed as what I see so long as their screens are Retina-capable?

So that clients only needed their single, Shared DID, both of their endpoints (desk sets) used the single DID.

In moving them to Teams Calling (D.R.), what approach should I take so that clients can continue to use / call the existing DID, but with each assistant of course having their unique AD / Teams login?

One suggestion I think might work is to provide each assistant with their own DID associated with their unique Teams account, and then create a Call queue similar to shared Receptionists-type approach. Am I on the right track? Or is there a better way?

How do I fix this?,"I have added my MS Outlook calendar to my Google Calendar and I can see all my meetings for the week on my Google calendar. The Google Calendar is my personal calendar so I can reduce work, school, and personal calendars to a single calendar.

The problem: If one of my meetings is changed or a meeting is added to my MS Outlook calendar by a colleague or supervisor it will not update this on my Google calendar. Sharing a Google calendar to a Google calendar is no issue. This updates automatically but not for MS Outlook.

Currently I have to re-share the Outlook calander every time there is an update but this is inefficient.

2021-11-09 02:30:50,Forms help,"I just discovered Teams forms and it looks like it will work well for something I've been trying to make more efficient for a while - at the moment it's a paper form...

The part I am struggling with is one section particularly.

The question is about different staff and their job role.

The current form looks like this:

So you type in the name - and then select their job role by ticking a box - and I can't find an option for that at the moment - you can either type something, or select from a list.

Anyone got any good ideas how to do that? The best I have come up with is to have a text entry question which then leads to another question with the options to select from for the job role.

Then is there a way to stop it asking once you have put them all in - sometimes that will be one person, sometimes it could be 10 - so once there are no more it should go on to the next question (best I have come up with is using branching and adding a ""no more"" option which would skip the rest of the name boxes.

2021-11-09 04:09:20,Removing Chat History for Supervised Chats,"Hi,

The students at our school have gotten out of control using Teams chat to talk to each other during the school day. To limit this usage, we decided to roll out Supervised Chat in Teams to only allow students to chat with teachers and staff at the school with Teams.

While putting the students in the restricted permissions group and leaving the teachers in full permissions works in theory, we have found that any students that had already had a chat history with another student was still able to chat with them in Teams. If they try to message a student they have never messaged before, it is blocked and they cannot message them, but any student they had ever chatted with before, even once, they were still able to talk to.

Does anyone know of a way to work around this? My first thought was being in Teams admin and deleting the chat history of the students, but it doesn't look like that is an option.",1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/qplzol/removing_chat_history_for_supervised_chats/,didthebhawkswin

Wonder if anyone has come across this before. Its happening with some of my users. 

Some info:

Online exchange. 
Teams phone system via Sip trunking.
User with numbers attached to them were done by giving them a Phone System license and then using the following powershell commands -EnterpriseVoiceEnabled $true, -HostedVoiceMail $true -onpremlineuri [Number] and finally giving them a voice routing policy via -CsonlineVoiceRoutingPolicy

Now they can phone external numbers and receive incoming calls fine but when an external number tries to leave a voicemail they receive the voicemail but the whole thing is silent, silent on teams and silent on outlook. When an internal person rings them the voicemail comes out fine, loud and clear. 

Strangely its only happening on new users, old users are working perfectly so I'm assuming I need to do something to the new users but I don't know what. It worth noting that I didn't set up the old users and the person who did no longer works here.

Any help would be appreciated because its driving me crazy 😅

I have recently installed Teams and created a new account against my Gsuite email and am logged into the business tenant (opposite of Personal?).

I'm having issues with the Teams add-in appearing in the Outlook client and I've tried a few things online.

I am starting to suspect that my email provider must be Exchange/365 based to allow Teams to communicate with my mail provider and by extension Outlook? would this be something to do with REST Sync?

If the resolution might be to move to a 365 email or perhaps an [Outlook.com](https://Outlook.com) email, would anyone have any recommendations on how to migrate emails from Gsuite to 365/Outlook.com?

I have a problem with the attendance list download.

I have planned a meeting sessions for some lessons for attenders of course. Every attendant has a permanent link for the session in e-mail, so there wasn't necessary to install MS Teams to their PCs.

The problem is that some attenders connect to the wrong meeting after the end of the regular meeting. So there was original attendance list, that was substituted with another attendance list. So after the attendance list download is in the .csv file one attender with connection time few seconds instead of all attenders which was involved in the original meeting.

Is it possible to get the original attendance list, not ""updated"" and rewrited attendant list?

At work we use chat for every meeting and for the majority of internal conversations. This means that there's always a long list of chats at the end of the week. At the moment I have to go down them one by one and mouse click through hiding them. 

I haven't been able to find anything online in all the hotkey lists of MS Teams that many folks have published. 

If there is no specific hotkey, is there a way to bulk close? I don't seem to be able to select more than one at a time.

2021-11-14 08:16:33,MS Teams Direct Routing - Name display for Mobiles?,"Hi, was wondering if someone can give me some pointers.  We have DR working via a Cisco CUBE and that's all good for inbound/outbound calls. 

However, users have their mobile numbers in their AD profile however when they call their landline from their mobile, it only displays the mobile number not their name. Can we get the name to display as well so it recognises mobiles which are referenced in  AD users? I've tried different mobile number formats (Eg. +e164, e164, local format) but it doesn't seem to  work. 

I had another company say it works for them so it seems to be possible?

2021-11-17 01:36:46,How can I set up Teams Voice to ring a group of people for anyone to pick up?,"I'm going through the Teams Voice free trial to see if it might be a suitable replacement for our current Vonage Business Cloud service. We currently have about ten office staff members that would be using the service. My first step in testing the viability is to try to recreate what we've got set up with Vonage and I'm stumbling at the first hurdle which is call groups.

We have two main call groups; Main Line and Out of Hours. When someone calls our main number, it will ring everyone in the Main Line group at the same time. Anyone in that group that is free can pick it up. Outside of work hours, anyone that calls our main number is given a menu choice of leaving a voice mail number or if it's an emergency, speaking to our out of hours team. The second option will then call people in the Out of Hours call group sequentially.

I'm struggling to find info on how to get this set up, in particular trying to get a main number call to ring a whole group of people. I can find info on setting up an auto attendant and call queues but we don't want a queue; to the caller, it should sound like they're getting through to someone straight away.

2021-11-17 06:18:08,Audio Feedback in Teams Rooms rooms combined setup,"So my organization has two meeting rooms with Zoom rooms equipment that we want to swap over to Teams Rooms. The rooms are primarily used individually for conferences, but occasionally the wall in-between can be removed and the rooms can be used in a combined setup. When wanting to conduct a conference in the combined setup, you can start the meeting on one device and invite the other rooms device (along with any external participants). The issue is that the audio in one room causes feedback through the microphone in the other room.  Our current solution is to just mute one rooms microphones and just pull one of the mini microphones from the main room as far into the 2nd room as it will reach. This obviously isn't the greatest solution as the audio quality of the 2nd room is significantly reduced.

&amp;#x200B;

We have Teams Rooms in a number of our other meeting rooms and they work really well. I have two teams rooms units at my desk. I'm intending to use them for testing in the rooms in question, but already in my testing at my desk, I can see that they run into the same audio feedback issue. Teams does have a handy coordinated meetings option built into the teams rooms settings. This is where you can set another Teams Rooms enabled account as a trusted device. Doing this means you can start a meeting on one device and it will automatically join the other unit into the meeting at the same time, but instead muting the microphone on entry to avoid audio feedback. This is handy, but then the combined setup is only using the mics from the main room. Another issue with this is that it doesn't seem to recognize when you don't want the rooms to be combined and will join the other device into meetings that the main device is on even when the wall is separating the rooms. This isn't great when the rooms are used individually.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is; Does anyone know of any solution where you can combine the two rooms audio steams in such a way that doesn't cause audio feedback, but also retains their ability to be used individually and simultaneously?

To help organize contacts on the phones I was building groups on the phones (production, Admin, Quality, etc..) so people could select those groups to quickly filter out who they want to call.  With people and phones that has teams accounts that is very simple.  I go into chat&gt;select contacts&gt;create new group&gt;add users to that group.  That group then shows up on my calls tab.  

The problem I am having is trying to create a contact for an analog phone and put it in any other group than speed dial.  In chat I can't create a contact because it wants to find an actual user.  If I create the contact in the calls contact tab it will only let me add it to speed dial group only.  Is there any way that people can create a contact with just a phone number and name and add that to a custom call group?  This would help us with our analog phones on the floor, but also help us organize our contractors and such.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/qwooe8/voip_contact_groups/,Petro62
2021-11-18 20:52:39,My camera was turned by someone else during the meeting.,"I was in a meeting in TEAMS and my camera was turned on during the break! When I came back it was on. And I quickly turned it off. And I would say at least 5 times my camera was turned on after it. However, after a while, another participant's camera was also turned on because we could see his room directly. And he was not in front of the laptop. 

I'm so angry that if the organizer can turn on other people's cameras? Or how did they manage to do that???

I've had so many meetings online, neither ZOOM, VOOV, GOOGLE MEET has this problem.

I'm very sure our cameras were turned on by an outsider as we were both away from the laptop and we did not leave it open or anything like that.

I don't want to make it a big deal although I may sound angry or anything. I just want to make sure it is not happening again to me or any of you.

We cannot figure out how to transfer to Voicemail from a Consult then Transfer CALL (its possible via chat).  Our employees prefer to have the caller introduced via a call, instead of a chat, and there does not appear to be a way to send the caller to voicemail from the consultation call.  We have been ""leaving"" the consultation call, resuming the original call, and then doing consult then transfer &gt; chat &gt;  send to voicemail.  This is a LOT of extra steps for what should just be a button.

Am I missing something?  Is there a simpler way to transfer to voicemail if the employee wants the call sent to voicemail?  TIA",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/qwtc0e/consult_then_transferto_voicemail/,snitz427

- Impossible, after a video call, to know who was in the call

- Impossible to add more emails at once to a group. So creating groups is super slow.
- Impossible to make a public channel private. It remains public forever (and giving a public link and later making the room private simplifies creating large teams)
- Impossible to actually delete a public channel. 
- By default, you do not get notifications unless they mention you, and you realise this only when you lose important team messages.
- To open the web app, change your browser settings to allow third-party cookies or allow certain trusted domains.
- The web app doesn't work in Firefox, Edge, Internet Explorer, and Chrome, or only works after in-depth sophisticated cookie setting. 
- There is no command line, which further aggravate  managing large Teams 
- On many occasions the account is stuck to ""we are having a problem, try later.""
- There is no way to download  something other than your OS download folder, which could quickly become a mess.

2021-11-22 23:16:27,Teams internal call queue without the need for a licence,"Hi guys

We have a customer with teams telephony, auto attendants, call queues and so on.  
But not all users have a voice license and a tel number and it is not planned that all users get these.

However the customer wants a possibility for an internal emergency calling option which should look someway like this:

A user, with or whitout number and phone license, can call a Number or User which then routes the call to a defined group of people.

It just should be possible for every user to call somewhere where the call is received by a couple of users which then dispatch the call. 

The customer wants also that the call goes to the defined users during the day and to an external number in the evening.

So basically an auto attendant / call queue scenario but without the need for phone numbers and phone licenses.

I don't know if this is possible and i'm at the end of my knowledge.

Has anyone of you a suggestion how to implement something like or smiilar like this?

Thanks in advance, i'm thankful for every help",1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/qznofi/teams_internal_call_queue_without_the_need_for_a/,jonas-riba

I am not sure exactly why this portal is just so bad compared to the other Office/MS admin portals, but it is.  This morning I had been updating some AA settings and the site would frequently not load the data or keep the changes I saved.  Now this could be an issue just for today, but  overall it is just frustrating to use.  I am sure people have their own experiences but for me the list of issues is sort but a big deal:

* Sluggish responsiveness
* Sections will not load or load correctly
* Need to clear browser data at times for data to load
* Some functions are just not easy to find
* No iOS or macOS support (not that people use Macs to manage this but the fact this portal does not work on an iPhone, iPad, or Safari is just bad)

Good:
- the search now covers the whole screen and not the side bar. You can expand to view more in messages, etc…much much better than the side bar screen we had.

Bad:
- Not sure if this is bug (I hope it is), when you click on a file searched, it opens in the browser in SharePoint. It doesn’t open in the Teams App which is not a great user experience. Would prefer it to open Teams. Hopefully this is not how it was designed to function. 

- You still can’t search and get folders in the results. It’s only files. Not sure why they can’t replicate how the SharePoint search functions. 
- Although the search expands the width of the page which is good, but there is no FULL folder path. It ends at the channel level. Even mouse hovering over the short folder path to reveal its full length would have been a better option. 
- Also with the folder path, would have been nice to make it a link to click to go to the folder where the file is saved.

So far there is no change since the Nov-03 update but the issue appeared right now. Let's say I want to type a list within my message, here is my keystrokes:

1. Type whatever above the list, for example ""Here is a list of issues we discussed:""
2. Press SHIFT-ENTER because ENTER will send the message instead of CR
3. Type ""-"" followed by the first item of the list, Teams correctly parsed it as a list and gives proper indentation. 
4. Press ENTER and expect Teams to automatically generate the second item with proper indentation
5. Somehow Teams sends the message instead.
6. I also tried to use SHIFT-ENTER after the first item, but this brings further indentation which is not what I want

I'm pretty sure lists work fine a few days ago, so I'm wondering what's the issue here?",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/r17mnm/list_in_chat_suddenly_broke/,redditthrowaway0315
2021-11-25 00:19:31,MTR propting for captcha when joining Webex meeting,"Background:

&amp;#x200B;

Recently refreshed all my Teams Rooms hardware from the Logitech SmartDock with Surface Pro devices to the Intel NUC/RallyBar Mini or Intel NUC/Rally Plus. 

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms:

&amp;#x200B;

When users direct join a recurring Webex meeting from the TAP console, they are prompted with a [captcha](https://imgur.com/a/4HlkZZG), pre-populated with the name/email information I've configured in the Third-Party Meetings settings for the console (I redacted that from the picture). The captcha prompt also comes up if that meeting invite was for a personal room. This didn't use to happen, and users would normally just one touch join, and it would pop up in the Web RTC window. 

Webex does have some [documentation](https://help.webex.com/en-US/article/WBX90534/Attendee-is-Prompted-for-CAPTCHA-While-Joining-the-Meeting) that states the captcha is only on first connection or when cookies are cleared, OR if connecting to a personal room. So my follow up question is how does the MTR application handle cookies since it's just opening the Webex meeting in the WebRTC window over the top of the running MTR application?

&amp;#x200B;

Was there a recent change that altered this behavior? Prior to the hardware upgrade, it wasn't acting like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do believe the old SmartDock hardware was running the 4.10 version of the MTR application, so i don't think application versioning is the culprit.",1.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/r18u1t/mtr_propting_for_captcha_when_joining_webex/,razorbackwoodwork
2021-11-25 01:09:42,Teams Room devices,"My org has a handful of conference rooms that we have cobbled together to allow people to use Teams.

Essentially what we have in each room is:

* SFF PC running Windows/Teams connected to a large display
* Prosumer webcam (i.e. Aver CAM520)
* Ceiling-mounted USB mic
* wireless keyboard/mouse on the conference table
* Barco ClickShare

Each room has its own dedicated Teams user account, so we tell people to invite the account for the room they're going to use when they book the meeting.

We encourage people to attach a PowerPoint / any other materials they will need to the meeting invite so they're easily accessible on the meeting room PC.

The challenges we're facing are:

* Some people are too intimidated by using the PC to run the meeting, even though it works exactly the same as Teams on their laptop.  They are asking for something simpler, where there is a touch screen on the table that runs everything.
* When people book a meeting in a conference room, they actually have to invite two additional accounts - they have to invite the room resource account (i.e. to reserve the room itself), and they also have to invite the Teams user for the particular room they're using).  We used to have a single Teams account that was shared across all conference rooms, but our Legal team didn't like that people in other conference rooms could potentially see confidential meeting info (i.e. chat, etc.) so they directed us to give each room its own account.
* If a guest comes in and needs to present they use the ClickShare to project to the display.  That works fine for presenting to the local room, but essentially breaks all the Teams functionality.
* We've also got a larger board room (approx 20x40) and it has been a challenge trying to find an audio solution that can pick up audio from everyone in the room.  We aren't allowed to penetrate the table, so we have to use wireless mics.  We have a cheap wireless mic system similar to [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0781YXB6C/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_R15YW0MY2DDWA61K4F35?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1), but with 8 mics.  It ""works"" but the audio quality is not great and very prone to echo.

I've heard of ""Teams Rooms"" as though they're a unified package that is basically a solution in a box.  Is that so, or do you have to work with an integrator for a custom solution?

We've tried to bring in an expert since this is definitely not our area of expertise.  Unfortunately, the org has been reticent to spend much money, so every 6-12 months enough people complain and they'll give us a couple thousand dollars to spend to limp along.

Curious is anyone has a ""go to"" kit / solution for meeting rooms that addresses some of the challenges we're facing?",1.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/r19yd9/teams_room_devices/,vrtigo1

My company is testing switching their analog telephony to Microsoft Teams Telephony using SBC/Direct Routing.

One of the issues we've come across is that those direct routing calls don't care if you're busy, away, DND or in another Teams call. They'll ring anyway and won't let the caller know you're busy or away.

I know there's an option for presence based routing in call queues but I was wondering if this was also available for direct calls. The closest thing I've seen is ""busy on busy"", which isn't exactly what we need, I'm afraid.

I am having a really hard time using this software. There are so many small bugs and issues everywere:
- The entire UI feels slow and sluggish. Conversations takes 1-2 seconds to load even though I just viewed them.
- Scrolling up in old chat makes the chat history jump down as new content is loaded.
- Viewing shared pictures only works sometimes. If it breaks you get stuck in a state you have go to another convo and back to try again.
- Sharing screen makes my laptop so sluggish I am barely able to do anything. This makes it useless for pair-programming unless I use a machine with a dedicated GPU.
- The UX for writing a list in a chat window feels very inconsistent as sometimes pressing enter sends the message, while other times it will create a new point in the list.
- You can easily get stuck in markdown if you write both the ` for the markdown-text, then move your cursor inside the markdown text.
- ""Copy image"" only copies the image within Teams, I cannot paste it to other apps like Paint or to my file system.

They told me they could close the windows but the sound coming from the windows would be cars and they did not hear anything resembling what I described. I sent them a video of what I was hearing and they told me they had no idea where this sound is coming from as they cannot hear it irl.

To save a message in Microsoft Teams means to place it in a dedicated space in the app where you can come back to it later. This is useful when perhaps someone shares an important resource and you want to save or bookmark it, or when you read a message but need to action it at a later time. Do you or will you use this feature?

2021-11-30 03:11:46,Help Needed with Logitech Rally Video Conferencing Set Up,"Hi all,

As the title states, I am looking for some help with a Logitech Rally system in a commercial conference room space. This is my first conference room and I cant help but feel overwhelmed with the software associated with the system. Any help at all would be appreciated!

Due to the supply chain issues we're all experiencing, I was forced to piecemeal the Logitech Rally hardware from a few different vendors. The Logitech hardware came together and functions as it should, although it didn't come with the NUC (with MTR preloaded) so that was left up to me to purchase separately. I bought the computer (Dell Optiplex 7080 mini) from a third party vendor as new in box. This computer didn't come with the Microsoft Teams Room software imaged to the device so that is what's holding me up. I upgraded from Windows 10 Pro to Enterprise, although the only way the IT manager of the corporation was able to give me a license was through a single bought license with a key (I later read on a Microsoft forum that the only acceptable license is through a volume license) so I believe that will cause an issue too. I followed all tutorials available and I'm not able to get anything loaded or imaged on the PC. There's not much help available through Logitech or Microsoft support so I was wondering what you think the best option would be.

Should I keep searching for a NUC with MTR already imaged on the PC? This is way over my head &amp; the head of IT did all he can to help already. What would you do in my situation?

2021-11-30 03:43:14,Why I find Microsoft Teams so incredibly difficult to use,"Hi

I am in an organisation where I am signed up to a large number of teams and channels. I am finding it very hard to keep track of all of the activity and the teams / channels I belong to. My impression is that Teams is not designed for keeping track of a large and complex workload. But I may be wrong, and please do send suggestions.

If I am organising a complex projects using files and folders on my computer, I can use the file system to structure my work. For example, if documents relate to a particular project, I can just place them in a folder whose name relates to the project. I can rename documents so that I can find and sort them easily. If you're on a mac (as I am) you can even use coloured labels.

Compare this with Teams. There seems to be no way to sort / categorise teams and channels, apart from by hiding them. What would really help is to be able to create my own labels. There are things called tags, but the ability to add / alter these seems to reside with the team owner, and there seems to be a restricted set of possible tags.

Then there's the fact that Teams seems to be designed to actually hide where you are in the hierarchy. If I am invited to a team/channel, the team/channel name is often truncated so I actually have no idea which team/channel I have been invited to. I cannot search for a team in grid view. I can use tags, but only those created by other people. I **can** search for a team in list view, but it will always filter out channels which do not correspond to the search term, so it is impossible to use this view to obtain an overview of which channels occur in which team. Sometimes, I am sent links to documents, but when the document is displayed, again, I have no idea which channel or Team I am in, as no path is shown. (NB I use a workaround where I open the document in Sharepoint, and bookmark the location in my browser - but surely this defeats the whole point of working in Teams?)

It seems that with Teams, Microsoft threw out all of the important design principles of folder structure which can help you to navigate in a desktop environment. I think part of this is due to the idea that organising stuff in folder slows you down, and what's more important are the interactions related to particular files / folders. There is something to be said for a relatively ""flat structure"". But from time to time, it **is** important to understand where documents are stored, or which team/channel I should be keeping an eye on, but the lack of anything resembling a folder structure or a way to tag teams/channels makes this extremely difficult. I think another motivation for this design decision is ""tabletification"" whereby every app needs to work properly on a touch screen, and moreover the user experience needs to be the same across different kinds of devices. But, many of us are not on these kinds of devices and are happy with smaller print, and a keyboard driven interface (NB the teams search bar is quite a nicely designed from a keyboard driven perspective). Surely it makes sense to adapt the user interface to the device?

So my question is this. What methods can I use to orientate myself in Teams which are akin to those I have at my disposal in a desktop environment? Is there any way for me to impose any kind of structure on the myriad of teams I have been signed up, given my inability to create my own tagging / filing system? Given the paucity of information displaying where you are in the systems (e.g. paths / breadcrumbs) how can I quickly track down relevant documents?",1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/r53th5/why_i_find_microsoft_teams_so_incredibly/,Historical-Tea-3438

2021-11-30 13:37:15,2nd Time User: This Software Seems... Bad,"I initially used Teams when it was required by an accrediting body to meet (I work in healthcare). I am used to managing my team using Google Meets or Zoom.  Typically, this means I""m sending a link to someone that they click, and at most, they're guided through a familiar process of creating login credentials.  At most.  

In the case of teams though, you are guided through double, and sometimes triple authentication: email, cell phone, and for some damn reason, Microsoft Authenticator app.  This, on top of creating login credentials.  At each step, Teams seems to crash, forget the last verification step and need re-verification, or be unable to locate your user in its database.  Even when it can do all of those things, it will not be able to connect you to a team you're not part of even if you have an account because, well, it's bad.  

""Sign in for a better experience"" is great advice when it actually works.  I have an interview tomorrow now using Teams and frankly, it's making everything more difficult.  

I download the app - I have a 2021 M1 Mac Mini running Big Sur - should be no issue. 

Teams guides me through a 6 step setup wizard that looks like it's from the 90's.  

Then it automatically starts the application offering me the option to sign in.  I vaguely remember using my personal email address for a MS account long ago, so I use the password reset link.  Then I try to login. 

MS Teams proceeds to cover my screen with an immovable window with nothing in it and won't budget until I verify my phone number.  I want to skip, but it crashes when I try.  I try again, and acquiesce to the phone number verification, at which point I enter a code and... MS Teams reports I need to have the code re-sent. This is not possible because the button to do this is now failing.  I restart teams.  

Magically, I am in after login this time.  I click the link for my interview from my email and.... Teams gives me a paragraph long error message with codes in it that seems to be saying ""sorry, you can't use Teams while you're logged in to access *this* meeting because you're not part of the team that sent the invitation for it.""  So now I have to join this meeting without being logged in.

""Starting on February 1, 2022, the *Direct Routing* SIP interface will only trust certificates that are signed by Certificate Authorities (CAs) that are part of the Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program.""

link to the CAs:  [Included CA Certificate List](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fccadb-public.secure.force.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FIncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT&amp;data=04%7C01%7Crob.geach%40sierra-cedar.com%7C9b04120105db4652cad208d9b371a943%7C0f1fa8606a954198b969fe5e480b6a85%7C0%7C0%7C637738123061686305%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=tkiIeIdLZ587%2FauEcQh%2BgxWC43MARxbo5uKZ%2FraCQlU%3D&amp;reserved=0) 

So if you look at the list, it's almost all root CAs (from the major public companies).  I have to assume there's some communication breakdown on microsoft's part and using any cert from an intermediate issuing CA that chains up to one of their root CAs means you'll be compliant?

When a user makes or receives a call to/from that number Teams matches that number to a random name.  This causes confusion among the users and in some cases when the dial a number out it goes to individual non-voice enabled teams account instead of direct routing-&gt;pstn.

Is there a way to disable this in Teams?  Changing the field info it AD will break a bunch of legacy applications that use it.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/r5vari/disabling_ad_reverse_phone_number_lookups_for/,SnooDonuts4137

2021-12-01 05:35:49,Stickers in MS Teams,"Hello there,

I have a user who cannot post stickers in Microsoft Teams. I went into their Microsoft Teams admin center and stickers are enabled for that particular user and organization wide. I have heard no other reports of users who cannot post stickers just this particular user. She is on mobile device and has tried uninstalling and reinstalling the MS teams app, rebooting the phone, etc. 

I went into the admin center for Teams and turned the setting off and saved, then turned on the setting and saved. Then had her sign in and out again but no luck. The content rating is set to Moderate and she has tried all different kinds of stickers but none seem to work. 

Is there something I am missing here? Is there possibly a setting that supersedes this setting? Or possibly a setting in InTune that would not allow her to post stickers? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/r5y3d6/stickers_in_ms_teams/,dkayem

Can we have this by granting them guest access?   


I took a look at this page but and it says 1:1 screen sharing is available for Teams Only to Teams Only users, what does that mean? These guests won't be in any organization as I will sent the invitation to their Gmail.

2021-12-01 16:15:11,"Windows 11 and bluetooth headset, no output","Since windows 10 I was using teams with bluetooth headphones, but not in hands free mode because of the poor quality, but with the headphones as regular headphones, and an external usb mic.

I just had to select between the two modes (stereo or hands free) in the output device in teams or windows.

Since Windws 11, there is no distinction in windows from Bluetooth regular mode, and hands free.

Now when I use teams, I think my headphones switch to hands free (this has been the case on w10 when the selected mic was the bluetooth headset one), but there is no sound (because windows is sending audio to regular bluetooth and the headset is switching to handsfree)

I'm sorry if it's a bit confused but since Windows 11 update, I am using regular wired headphones because of this.

We have an automated process that creates a project channel under each of our main client teams, each of the project channels get pre-populated with a folder structure, using power automate. But it now seems this process is failing as the folder that gets created with a channel is no longer being created at channel creation stage, it only seems to appear when i open the‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­channel and go into the files tab, it doesn't show in SharePoint at all until I do this. Its a pretty big issue for my company as all our projects have pre-populated template folder structures that they need access too. Is anyone else seeing this happen? I had a similar thing happen when creating a main team that the general folder wasn't being created until you went into the files, this resolved itself after putting a delay in and posting a message. But this still doesn't seem right.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MicrosoftTeams/comments/r6dkeq/issue_with_team_channel_creation_and_sharepoint/,Carbon-Flex
2021-12-01 20:50:53,Automatic Room Assignments,"Our team would like to have a voluntary virtual coffee break type of meeting once a week to have a way yo keep in touch outside of day to day work meetings.
If we have 30 people who COULD join the meeting, the idea would be to have 6 breakout rooms so that no more than 5 people would be in a room. 

How does teams handle this if, say, one day only 6 people join. Will it put 5 people in one room and 1 person by themselves in another? Or will it evenly distribute them?
Or, if one day only 3 people join, will it keep them in the same room?
